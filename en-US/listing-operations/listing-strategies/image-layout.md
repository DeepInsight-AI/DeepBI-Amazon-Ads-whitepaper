# Product Image Layout

On the Amazon platform, product image layout is a key factor affecting consumer purchase decisions. As sellers, how to effectively showcase product core features through appropriate images, improve click-through rates and conversion rates, is a question every seller needs to think deeply about. A high-quality image layout can effectively attract consumer attention, convey product selling points, and ultimately facilitate purchase decisions. This article will explore image material sources, image layout techniques, and key points in detail.

## Image Material Sources

On Amazon, product images play a crucial role. To ensure image quality and effectiveness, many sellers use high-quality image materials. The following are some commonly used free image material websites and resources:

1. **Pixabay**: This is a platform providing free images and video materials, all materials can be used for commercial purposes without authorization. It has a huge image library covering various themes, and sellers can choose images suitable for their products.

2. **Pexels**: Pexels provides high-quality copyright-free images suitable for commercial use. Its image library is updated frequently, covering a large number of high-definition images, especially suitable for showcasing product details and usage scenarios.

3. **Picjumbo**: Picjumbo is a free high-quality image website providing various images suitable for e-commerce. Its materials are diverse, suitable for various product displays, and don't require paid subscriptions.

4. **Life of Pix**: This platform provides free high-resolution images suitable for commercial projects. Images cover a wide range and have no copyright issues, suitable for product display, brand promotion, etc.

5. **Raumrot**: Raumrot provides high-quality image materials suitable for various purposes, including e-commerce, blogs, and marketing. Some of its images have unique styles, suitable for adding brand characteristics.

6. **Bing Browser (Bing Search)**: Through Bing image search, sellers can also find a large number of free and high-quality images. Bing search provides filtering functions to filter out copyrighted images, thus finding suitable materials.

By obtaining high-quality image materials through these websites, sellers can save time and costs, focusing on other optimization tasks. However, when using these free materials, it's still necessary to ensure images are consistent with product positioning and comply with Amazon's image requirements.

## Image Layout Techniques and Key Points

In Amazon product pages, image layout is an important factor affecting consumer behavior. A strategic image layout can improve product click-through rates, conversion rates, and ultimately promote sales. To ensure maximum effectiveness of image layout, sellers need to follow some basic techniques and key points.

### Main Image: The Key to Clicks

On Amazon product pages, the main image plays a crucial role. It's the first image consumers see and a key factor affecting click-through rates. The main image needs to be clear, concise, and quickly convey product core features. According to Amazon's requirements, the main image should have a white background and display the complete product image, avoiding any irrelevant content such as brand logos, promotional text, or other unrelated elements. An excellent main image should allow consumers to clearly understand basic product information such as color, shape, function, etc.

The main image is the primary factor attracting potential buyers to click, so sellers should ensure the main image is high quality and complies with platform regulations. Appropriate lighting, clear resolution, and simple yet intuitive display are all effective means to improve main image click-through rates.

### Second and Third Images: Core Selling Points and Function Display

On the Amazon platform, data shows that buyers typically make purchase decisions in only 7 seconds. Therefore, after the main image, the second and third images are crucial for improving conversion rates. The main image may attract consumer clicks, but the second and third images determine whether they continue browsing and ultimately complete purchases. Since consumer attention is very limited, they usually only decide whether to continue browsing within a few seconds. Therefore, the second and third images must have strong appeal and persuasiveness, directly showcasing product selling points and core functions.

**The second image** is usually used to showcase product core selling points. Unlike the main image which only provides product appearance, the second image needs to impress consumers through function display or detail close-ups. For example, if the product is a waterproof Bluetooth speaker, the second image can showcase the speaker's waterproof function, highlighting its durability and suitability for outdoor activities. At this time, sellers should ensure the image can clearly convey core product value, such as "waterproof" or "long battery life" and other key features, attracting consumers who truly need these features or functions.

**The third image** should be used to showcase product versatility or usage scenarios. When making purchase decisions, consumers often need to clearly understand whether the product suits their needs. The third image can meet this need through actual usage scenarios. Taking sports shoes as an example, the third image can showcase sports shoes suitable for running, hiking, fitness, and other sports scenarios. Through scenario display, consumers can more clearly understand how this product integrates into their lives, increasing product appeal.

Meanwhile, research has found that by adjusting image order, even just adjusting the order of the second and third images, can significantly improve conversion rates in some cases. Sellers can find the image order and layout that most impresses consumers through repeated testing. For example, in an outdoor sports product, adjusting the positions of the second and third images, focusing on showcasing product core selling points rather than additional functions, may more effectively attract consumer attention, thereby improving conversion rates.

### Fourth to Sixth Images: Scenario Display and Need Implication

After product display, the main task of the fourth to sixth images is to further stimulate consumer purchase desire through scenarios and need implications. These images usually showcase products in actual usage scenarios or highlight product unique selling points through comparison with competitors.

For example, for a waterproof Bluetooth speaker, sellers can showcase its usage scenarios in outdoor, beach, rainy weather, etc. This way, consumers can not only see the product itself but also mentally construct applicable scenarios for the product, thereby stimulating their purchase needs. Scenario images need to be designed based on target keywords, ensuring text and images complement each other, helping consumers better understand product applicable scenarios.

Additionally, sellers can reference competitor success cases to optimize their scenario images. If competitors have already showcased certain scenarios or needs, sellers should consider improving these scenario performances, doing better than competitors. For example, if most products in the market showcase beach usage scenarios, sellers can consider adding more creative usage scenarios to attract consumer attention.

### Seventh Image: Brand Story and Strength Display

At the end of image layout, the seventh image is usually used to showcase brand stories or product unique selling points. This image can convey brand core values or environmental concepts, or highlight product quality guarantees, honor certificates, etc. According to US consumer surveys, one of the factors consumers value most when purchasing is brand environmental image and social responsibility. Therefore, sellers can use this image to showcase brand environmental advantages, perhaps telling brand founding stories, conveying brand emotional value.

If the brand doesn't have sufficient consumer reviews or recognition, sellers can also put influencer or blogger reviews or recognition in the seventh image to enhance brand credibility. This approach can establish stronger brand image for products lacking reviews and provide more trust assurance for potential customers.

### Eighth to Ninth Images: Adding Extra Weight and Improving Completeness

The eighth and ninth images not only help increase product completeness but also improve Listing quality scores. Even without perfect images, sellers can upload white background images or other related additional images, which not only fills the Listing but also ensures product display completeness. Especially when there aren't enough high-quality images, uploading a clear white background image can at least ensure the Listing isn't considered lacking images, avoiding potential negative impacts.

These additional images can include different angles of the product or showcase additional information consumers might care about, such as size comparison, weight, etc. Through these additional images, sellers can provide more product information to consumers, helping them make purchase decisions.

## Conclusion

Product image layout is decisive for Amazon sellers. Through carefully designed image layouts, sellers can effectively improve product click-through rates and conversion rates, thereby increasing sales. Each image has its specific role, from the main image's appeal to the second and third images' function display, to the fourth to sixth images' scenario display, each image layout should be carefully designed to ensure maximum consumer attention and convey product core selling points. By reasonably applying these techniques, sellers can stand out in fierce competition and gain more exposure and sales opportunities.
