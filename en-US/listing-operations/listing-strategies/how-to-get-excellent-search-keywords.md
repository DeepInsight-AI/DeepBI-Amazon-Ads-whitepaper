# How to Get Excellent Search Keywords

On the Amazon platform, search keyword selection directly affects product exposure, click-through rates, and conversion rates. Reasonable keyword layout can help sellers gain more traffic, thereby improving sales. Therefore, precise keyword selection is one of the key steps in Listing optimization. This section will explore four main sources of search keywords in depth, helping sellers understand how to efficiently obtain keywords and improve product search rankings.

## Traditional Methods for Excellent Search Keywords

### 1. Backend BA Data: Supporting Data-Driven Decisions

In Amazon's seller center, BA (Business Analytics) data is an important tool for sellers to conduct market analysis and keyword optimization. Through BA data, sellers can obtain detailed information about sales, traffic, click-through rates, conversion rates, etc. Using this data, sellers can accurately evaluate the performance of currently used keywords, discover potential effective keywords, and optimize their Listings.

A key point of BA data lies in its precision and real-time nature. Through backend traffic reports, sellers can clearly understand which keywords bring the most traffic and orders. These keywords are usually highly aligned with sellers' target audiences, making them important reference bases for optimizing keyword lists.

**How to Use BA Data to Select Keywords:**

- **Traffic and Conversion Rate Analysis**: Check which keywords bring more traffic and higher conversion rates, and further optimize the use of these keywords.
- **Keyword Performance Comparison**: By analyzing the performance of different keywords, determine which keywords have the highest ROI (Return on Investment) and adjust advertising strategies accordingly.
- **Long-term Trend Tracking**: Use BA data to track long-term trends of keywords, discover emerging keywords and quickly apply them.

**Advantages of BA Data:**

- **Precise Traffic and Conversion Analysis**: Through BA data, sellers can accurately evaluate which keywords perform best and make adjustments.
- **Real-time**: BA data can provide real-time feedback, allowing sellers to quickly see the effects of adjustments and optimize in time.

### 2. Competitor PPC Data: Insights into Market Competition

By analyzing competitors' PPC (Pay-Per-Click) advertising data, sellers can understand which efficient keywords competitors are using. Competitor PPC data reflects their advertising strategies, so it can serve as a reference to help sellers discover potential keywords and optimize advertising strategies.

However, sellers need to be careful when using competitor PPC data: keywords used by competitors may not be suitable for all sellers, especially new products or products with different positioning. Competitors have accumulated high quality scores and rankings through long-term advertising, so their high-ranking keywords may not be suitable for short-term advertising. Therefore, sellers need to reasonably select competitor PPC keywords based on their own product characteristics, market positioning, and advertising budgets.

**How to Select Keywords Through Competitor PPC Data:**

- **Analyze Competitor Ad Core Keywords**: Find keywords that appear frequently in competitor ads and evaluate whether these words are suitable for your products.
- **Pay Attention to Keyword Historical Accumulation**: Understand whether competitor keyword performance is improved through long-term accumulated advertising, avoiding blind copying in the short term.
- **Evaluate Keyword Relevance**: Choose keywords highly relevant to your products with high conversion potential rather than directly copying competitor keywords.

**Advantages of Competitor PPC Data:**

- **Direct Reflection of Competitive Strategies**: Through competitor PPC data, sellers can understand their specific advertising strategies and make corresponding adjustments.
- **Discover Popular Keywords**: Through competitor ads, sellers can quickly discover popular and efficient keywords.

### 3. Competitor Keyword Reverse Lookup: Expanding with External Tools

Competitor keyword reverse lookup is another method to obtain keywords. Sellers can use third-party tools such as Helium 10, Jungle Scout, etc., to understand keywords used in competitor Listings by reverse looking up competitor ASINs. These tools can scan and display all keywords used in competitor Listings, including backend search terms and keywords used in advertising.

Through competitor keyword reverse lookup, sellers can not only obtain keywords that directly compete with competitors but also discover some underutilized market opportunities. This approach is especially suitable for finding long-tail keywords and niche market opportunities.

**How to Select Keywords Through Competitor Keyword Reverse Lookup:**

- **Use Third-party Tools to Reverse Lookup Competitor ASINs**: Scan competitor Listings through tools, find all keywords they use, and evaluate which keywords are suitable for your products.
- **Find Long-tail Keywords**: Reverse lookup tools usually discover many long-tail keywords with less competition, helping sellers find more traffic sources.
- **Analyze Competitor Success Points**: Reverse lookup competitor keywords and related strategies, discover the reasons for their success, and judge whether these keywords are valuable to you.

**Advantages of Competitor Keyword Reverse Lookup:**

- **Precise Keyword Information**: Through third-party tools, obtain keywords used by competitors, helping sellers precisely find competitive points.
- **Discover More Niche Market Opportunities**: Through reverse lookup tools, sellers can discover more potential, underdeveloped keywords and markets.

### 4. BSR Title Extraction: Reference Hot-selling Product Keyword Layout

BSR (Best Seller Rank) is an important indicator for measuring product sales performance on the Amazon platform. By analyzing titles of products in the top 100 BSR rankings, sellers can extract excellent keyword layout strategies. Especially for hot-selling products, their keyword layouts usually accurately capture consumer needs. Referencing these hot-selling product titles can help sellers quickly identify which keywords are most popular in the market.

When extracting BSR titles, sellers can pay attention to the following points:

- **Title Keyword Usage**: Analyze common keywords in titles of products with high BSR rankings, especially those that clearly express core product selling points.
- **Keyword Distribution**: Observe the arrangement order of keywords in hot-selling product titles. Usually, the most important keywords appear in the first half of titles.
- **Balance of Long-tail and Broad Keywords**: Hot-selling product titles usually combine short-tail and long-tail keywords to improve traffic and conversion through this balance.

**How to Select Keywords Through BSR Title Extraction:**

- **Analyze Hot-selling Product Titles**: Check titles of products in the top 100 BSR rankings, extract and record keywords that appear frequently in these titles.
- **Combine Your Product Characteristics**: Extract keywords highly aligned with your product characteristics and market demand and use them.
- **Maintain Keyword Diversity and Relevance**: By referencing different product titles, avoid keyword singularity and maintain diversity and relevance of keyword combinations.

**Advantages of BSR Title Extraction:**

- **Discover Efficient Keyword Combinations**: By analyzing hot-selling product titles, obtain the most popular keyword combinations in the market, helping sellers improve product exposure.
- **Learn from Industry Success Cases**: By referencing hot-selling product keyword layouts, sellers can learn and reference successful cases to improve their Listing performance.

## DeepBI's Search Keyword Strategy

In the field of Amazon advertising, keyword selection and optimization have always been core factors determining advertising effectiveness. However, traditional manual keyword selection methods are not only inefficient but also prone to falling into the limitations of empiricism, making it difficult to cope with rapidly changing market demands. Through long-term practice, I have found that truly efficient keyword strategies need to rely on data-driven intelligent systems, and DeepBI is exactly such a tool that can help sellers break through bottlenecks. Its unique strategy system not only solves the problem of single keyword sources but also builds a sustainable keyword ecosystem through multi-dimensional screening and dynamic optimization.

### 1. Initial Keyword Mining Logic

The first step of any advertising campaign is to find suitable traffic entry points. DeepBI's intelligent system advances from two directions simultaneously: one is keyword mining based on user search behavior, and the other is indirect keyword acquisition through competitor ASIN interception. These two methods are not isolated but complement each other, forming a complete data closed-loop.

Automatic keyword addition strategy is the basic module of keyword mining. The system analyzes historical order data, screens out search terms with good ACOS performance recently and adds them to the keyword library. After removing interference characters, it synchronously delivers in three forms: broad match, phrase match, and exact match. At the same time, under phrase/broad match mode, it can continue to generate new search terms that meet expansion conditions and continue to add them to the keyword library, forming a keyword expansion chain. For example, when users search "waterproof Bluetooth headphones" and place orders, if the system judges that the word meets inclusion conditions, it will not only include the exact word but also expand long-tail variants like "sports waterproof headphones" and "swimming wireless headphones" in subsequent delivery of that word, thereby covering broader potential needs.

Meanwhile, automatic ASIN addition strategy opens another keyword acquisition path. When advertising is delivered on competitor detail pages or search result pages, the system records which ASINs brought actual conversions. More importantly, user search terms associated with these ASINs are automatically attributed. For example, if a "portable juicer cup" gets orders through competitor ASIN advertising, the system will reverse track the search terms users initially used (such as "mini juicer") and include them in the keyword library. This ASIN feedback keyword mechanism is especially suitable for the early stage of new products lacking keyword data.

### 2. Dynamic Screening Under Four-layer Funnel

Establishing an initial keyword library is only the first step. How to screen out truly high-quality "dark horses" from massive candidate words is the key to determining advertising efficiency. DeepBI adopts a layered progressive four-layer traffic mechanism, like a precise sieve, gradually filtering out high-value words.

The exploration layer is the system's vanguard, focusing on "casting a wide net." This stage centers on ASIN advertising, prioritizing seizing competitor traffic entry points. The logic is: when users browse competitor pages, it indicates their needs are clear. At this time, inserting more cost-effective alternative product ads has higher conversion probability. Meanwhile, the system records these users' original search terms, accumulating materials for subsequent keyword delivery.

The initial screening layer begins to introduce efficiency evaluation. The system screens out keywords and ASINs that generate orders within a short period (such as 7 days) and meet ACOS standards, marking them as potential candidates. Notably, this data will feed back to the exploration layer in real-time, optimizing the initial traffic pool. For example, if a long-tail keyword "mountain climbing sun hat" performs excellently in the initial screening layer, the system will immediately increase delivery of its associated ASINs in the exploration layer, forming a positive cycle.

Keywords and ASINs entering the precision layer need to withstand more stringent stability tests. The system analyzes their long-term conversion performance, eliminating "flash in the pan" words with occasional orders. For example, a seasonal keyword "Christmas gift box" might explode in the short term but its value drops sharply over time. The system will automatically reduce its weight. Keywords finally entering the volume expansion layer usually have triple characteristics of high click-through rate, high conversion rate, and low ACOS, becoming key objects for budget allocation.

### 3. Synergistic Effect of Differentiated Control Strategies

Excellent keyword libraries need dynamic management. DeepBI's strategy system is like an experienced commander, implementing precise control for keywords with different performances.

For newly discovered potential words, the exposure increase strategy moderately raises bids to help them quickly obtain initial data. When exposure exceeds the threshold, the exposure control strategy immediately intervenes, avoiding budget waste through bid micro-adjustments. This "exploration-control" balance mechanism ensures growth space for new words while preventing blind spending.

Keywords that have proven conversion capabilities enjoy special treatment. The order keyword strategy implements gentle price increases for words with excellent historical performance but insufficient recent exposure, while the key word strategy takes more aggressive bid increases for words with recent hot conversions. The two form gradient management, ensuring high-value words continuously gain exposure advantages.

In contrast, the ACOS control strategy has a "brake" function. When a keyword's click volume meets standards but conversion rate remains consistently low, the system automatically reduces its bid, compressing inefficient traffic. This bidirectional adjustment mechanism ensures advertising budgets always flow to channels with the highest returns.

### 4. Practical Value in Complex Scenarios

In actual operations, DeepBI's strategy combinations show strong scenario adaptability. Facing red ocean categories with intense competition for major keywords, the system prioritizes mining long-tail keywords, gradually verifying their value through the four-layer mechanism. For example, when a home furnishing seller encounters obstacles with the high-competition keyword "desk lamp," the system automatically turns to niche areas like "eye-protection study desk lamp" and "Nordic bedside lamp," ultimately obtaining precise traffic at lower costs.

For new product promotion, traditional methods often require weeks of trial and error, while DeepBI's exploration and initial screening layers can establish high-quality keyword libraries in a short time. Actual test data from a smart hardware seller shows that after using this system, keyword coverage during the new product period increased 3 times compared to manual operations, with ACOS reduced by over 40%. This efficiency leap comes from the system's full utilization of the ASIN feedback keyword mechanism.

### 5. Future Form of Intelligent Advertising

Looking at DeepBI's strategy system, its core innovation lies in connecting discrete operational actions into a closed loop through algorithms. From initial keyword discovery to gradual verification through four-layer funnels to fine operations of differentiated control, the entire process requires no human intervention yet is more forward-looking than human decisions.

I have witnessed multiple cases: an outdoor product seller locked in trend keywords like "spring hiking equipment" in advance through the system before peak season; a maternal and baby brand used the ASIN feedback mechanism to mine dozens of high-conversion long-tail keywords unnoticed by competitors. These successes are not accidental but inevitable results of data-driven strategies.

In today's increasingly complex Amazon advertising, relying on human power to fight algorithms is unrealistic. DeepBI's value lies not only in reducing ACOS as a specific indicator but also in providing an evolvable intelligent framework—it can self-adjust with market changes and continuously optimize with data accumulation, ultimately upgrading advertising delivery from "experience gambling" to "scientific experiments." For sellers pursuing long-term growth, this may be the real competitive barrier.
