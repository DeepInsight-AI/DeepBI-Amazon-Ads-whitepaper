# DeepBI Cannot Rapidly Improve Effects in Short Term

In the process of Amazon advertising intelligent operations, customers often have high expectations for AI capabilities, especially in an industry with high internal competition and enormous production pressure. Many customers hope to achieve a qualitative leap in advertising delivery overnight with the help of AI. However, it must be clear that AI optimization is not magic. DeepBI's intelligent price adjustment system and advertising strategy optimization process is a dynamic adjustment process based on real data, following scientific rhythm, and continuously progressive. This process not only relies on the intelligent exploration capabilities of the algorithm itself but also requires customers to give the AI system sufficient time to gradually learn, verify, screen, and optimize in real market environments. This is a basic cognition that any responsible AI advertising system must convey to customers.

First, DeepBI's AI system needs to go through an exploration exposure stage in the early stages of advertising delivery. DeepBI does not rely solely on historical category data or templated recommendations for initial bidding but actively tests which keywords, competitor ASINs, and audience traffic pools are more suitable for current products in the current market environment through real-time bidding and data feedback mechanisms. This process is not simple "trial and error" but systematic, batch-based, and efficient exploration based on dynamic data verification. According to a large amount of practical data verification, DeepBI's AI system usually needs a **7-14 day exploration cycle** to gradually screen out exposure entries that are highly compatible with products and lock in high-potential traffic pools.

At this stage, DeepBI will intelligently adjust keyword bidding, dynamically expand ASIN delivery, and quickly eliminate inefficient traffic entries based on exposure-click-conversion full-chain data, while gradually focusing on high-conversion keywords and ASINs that can bring stable orders. It is particularly important to note that **the learning curve of AI systems is not linear, and its initial adjustments are slow and conservative**. On one hand, this is to prevent excessive aggressiveness leading to budget waste, and on the other hand, it is to accumulate more representative delivery samples for the system. Only when the AI model establishes more accurate traffic preference predictions will it gradually accelerate the price increase and volume expansion rhythm in the later stages, entering the high-efficiency growth stage.

According to DeepBI's statistical data verified by a large number of customers, **60%-70% of products can usually observe obvious trend improvements within 10-15 days after delivery launch**. This means that most products can initially establish exposure conversion closed-loops within two weeks through DeepBI's optimization, and key indicators such as conversion rates, ACOS, and exposure begin to gradually improve. For such products, the DeepBI system can leverage the traffic leverage of product exposure within about 14 days, thereby driving sales to achieve 2-3 times growth. This cycle is not accidental but the result of the synergistic effect of DeepBI's intelligent exploration strategy, dynamic bidding mechanism, and traffic feedback algorithm.

Of course, about 30%-40% of products will have relatively slower optimization processes, usually requiring **about 30 days of observation and continuous adjustment**. These products often have the following situations: First, the product Listing itself has significant optimization space, such as insufficient main image attractiveness, bullet points that fail to accurately convey selling points, or relatively weak review quantity and star ratings. Second, the category competition is exceptionally fierce, leading to abnormally high keyword bidding, and AI needs more time to find cost-controllable and acceptable conversion rate traffic entry points. Third, the product itself has strong seasonality or niche audiences, with relatively scarce market basic traffic, and the AI system needs more time to accumulate effective click data. In such cases, DeepBI will not only continuously optimize through the advertising price adjustment system but also provide timely product-level improvement suggestions to customers through traffic data feedback, assisting customers to gradually improve overall delivery effectiveness from multiple aspects such as Listing optimization, pricing adjustment, and main image optimization.

It is particularly worth emphasizing that DeepBI always adheres to a bottom line: **the improvement of advertising effectiveness is the result of the combined effect of AI systems, product foundations, and operational cooperation**. If customers have obvious problems with product Listings but are unwilling to cooperate with adjustments, or set advertising budgets too conservatively, it is easy to cause the AI system to fail to play its due optimization effects. The DeepBI system can help customers dynamically adjust keyword bidding, intelligently control exposure strategies, optimize budget allocation, and even quickly seize traffic through precise strikes on competitor ASINs, but the AI system cannot compensate for traffic losses caused by product main image defects, product pricing strategy imbalances, or severely damaged ratings and reputation. Therefore, customers must fully understand that the advertising system is only one link in the traffic and conversion path, and the competitiveness of the product itself is always the foundation of advertising effectiveness.

In addition, regarding misconceptions that some customers may have, the DeepBI team must clearly communicate to customers: **the AI system cannot accurately identify all high-conversion traffic with 100% accuracy from the start**. The system needs time to gradually align with real user behavior paths through multiple rounds of data accumulation and algorithm iteration. This intelligent learning process requires at least two weeks of stable delivery, and customers need to continuously monitor key parameters such as advertising budgets, inventory, and keyword bidding to cooperate with the AI system to complete dynamic adjustments. If customers expect to see significant ACOS drops and rapid order growth in just two or three days, this is a misunderstanding of AI advertising system capabilities and even an unscientific expectation.

Overall, the standard growth path of DeepBI's advertising optimization system can be roughly divided into **three stages**: **The first stage is a 7-14 day intelligent exploration period, mainly focusing on traffic testing and exposure matching; the second stage is a 15-30 day optimization improvement period, where the system continuously screens quality traffic, gradually expands exposure scope, and improves production performance; the third stage is a stable volume expansion period after 30 days, where the system has basically locked in high-conversion keywords and quality competitor traffic, entering an efficient delivery rhythm.** Different products may have cycle differences due to factors such as product strength and market competitive environment, but this overall rhythm has been fully verified in thousands of actual delivery cases.

In summary, DeepBI is not a delivery system that pursues "quick miracle effects" but an intelligent optimization tool that deeply integrates data-driven and practical experience. It helps customers improve advertising delivery effectiveness rhythmically within a reasonable time cycle through scientific staging, dynamic price adjustment, traffic verification, and closed-loop feedback mechanisms. Customers need to maintain scientific and rational expectations for the AI system, fully give the system time for deep learning and continuous adjustment, and actively cooperate with product optimization, inventory management, and budget configuration to truly release the long-term value of AI-driven advertising delivery. The DeepBI team will also continue to accompany customers through the AI growth curve and achieve ideal advertising delivery results through perfect algorithms, solid technical support, and professional operational services.
