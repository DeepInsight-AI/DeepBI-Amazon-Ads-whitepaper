# DeepBI's Other Non-Product Advantages

DeepBI's overall advantages are not only reflected in product functionality and application strategies themselves, but more importantly, in the technical systems, organizational capabilities, and compound team backgrounds behind them. The DeepBI team is not a traditional advertising product developer or traffic operator. Its unique advantages come from the rich and multi-dimensional cross-career paths of team members, which span platform parties, technology R&D parties, data service parties, and front-line advertising practitioners, forming comprehensive and in-depth full-chain understanding and capability accumulation.

## 1. DeepBI Founder's Background and Practical Accumulation

DeepBI's founders first met at Baidu more than ten years ago, during the golden stage of explosive development in China's search engine marketing (SEM) industry. During their time at Baidu, the founders deeply participated in the design and optimization of early bidding ranking systems, personally experiencing the entire industry's technological leap from manual delivery and extensive exposure management to relying on algorithms for refined traffic distribution and conversion attribution. This experience not only established the team's initial understanding of the core concept of "data-driven advertising optimization" but, more importantly, in the underlying logic design of bidding ranking systems, they honed their practical capabilities in understanding user search intent, keyword matching mechanisms, real-time bidding algorithms, and high-concurrency processing of large-scale data. At that time, DeepBI's founders had already deeply mastered how to optimize ranking through machine learning algorithms, how to capture and respond to dynamic changes in user search behavior in real-time, and how to adjust bids in extremely short periods to adapt to competitive landscapes. These core capabilities were already advanced when the industry was still in an extensive stage. This experience enabled the team to form systematic cognition of the essence behind traffic, and this capability accumulation became an important underlying technical support for DeepBI's subsequent construction of AI advertising systems.

After leaving Baidu, DeepBI founder members respectively entered China's top internet platforms, such as JD.com, ByteDance, Tencent, etc., and held important positions in core business departments such as e-commerce, content, and social networking. The practical training in these positions enabled the team to have more three-dimensional and in-depth understanding of advertising delivery chains in different application scenarios:

1) In e-commerce scenarios, DeepBI's founders deeply understood the full-chain behavioral data from users entering the platform, browsing products, clicking ads, adding to cart, to final orders. Since enterprise customers have higher data governance requirements, more complex organizational structures, and more stringent privacy compliance needs, this not only limited them to advertising system optimization but also deepened into enterprise-level data pipeline design, data governance architecture construction, real-time computing system implementation, cross-system data integration, data visualization, and multi-source data fusion. The accumulation in this stage enabled them to have the capability to design high-concurrency, high-availability, globally adaptive enterprise-level data systems, and have mature solutions for typical problems in cross-border e-commerce, cross-category delivery, and cross-department data flow processes. They also personally built PB-level data processing frameworks, participated in enterprise data asset construction and distributed computing engine deployment, and deeply understood the technical pain points and management difficulties enterprises face in advertising data applications during this process. This full-chain capability from platform traffic to enterprise data became an important technical barrier that distinguishes DeepBI from other tools that only stay at the advertising algorithm level.

2) In content consumption scenarios, they mastered how information flow ads precisely push based on user interest graphs and how to influence user dwell time and click probability through algorithm design.

3) In social ecosystems, they participated in the construction of social advertising recommendation systems, accumulating algorithm design experience in social behavior fission and crowd interest diffusion. These compound backgrounds not only enabled the team to master the unique bidding rules, attribution models, and advertising product structures of various platforms but, more importantly, they personally participated in the design and implementation of multiple advertising systems from zero to one, accumulating the dynamic evolution patterns of advertising traffic in complex systems during actual operations. Especially on platforms like ByteDance, the team not only applied traditional CTR prediction technology but also actively promoted the practical engineering application of AI advertising algorithms such as CVR modeling and oCPX intelligent bidding strategies during the deep learning stage. These valuable practical experiences enabled the team to form deep insights into the paths for AI-driven advertising effectiveness improvement, key points of data feedback closed-loop, and balance strategies between different optimization objectives.

More importantly, **DeepBI's founders are not stuck in the perspective of platform construction or technical services, but as Amazon Top 100 brand sellers, personally participate in the full-chain practice of Amazon advertising as advertisers.** From ad budget formulation, ad group structure design, keyword delivery strategy, ASIN competitor offense and defense, to core actions such as data monitoring, budget adjustment, bidding optimization, keyword negation, and traffic attribution in daily delivery, the team personally experienced the entire process of Amazon advertising operations. Facing the challenge of budget allocation for massive SKUs, how to prioritize seizing high-conversion traffic under limited budgets, how to find real traffic dark horses among thousands of keywords and ASINs, and how to scientifically judge advertising effectiveness and continuously optimize, these issues have all been repeatedly verified and practically accumulated by the team. Especially in the process of daily optimization of thousands of keywords and deep participation in competitor ASIN strategy construction, the team not only accumulated systematic ad account management experience but also summarized efficient delivery paths that can be widely applied in real account practice. This process endowed the team with strong empathy for advertisers' core demands, deeply understanding sellers' urgent needs for cost reduction and efficiency improvement, precise traffic acquisition, and predictable advertising ROI growth, and also clearly understanding the energy shortage and operational bottlenecks that manual operations face when dealing with complex traffic. This complete practical background across platforms, positions, and roles enables DeepBI to always insist on taking advertisers' real pain points as the core driving force in product design, ensuring that product solutions are not only scientific and feasible but also have real and practical value.

## 2. DeepBI Development Team's Technical Background

DeepBI's team structure also has extremely strong global technical capabilities and industrial competitiveness. The company's core R&D team members come from top domestic internet companies such as Baidu, Tencent, and JD.com, with an average of more than ten years of R&D practical experience in AI and business intelligence fields. Some key members have been deeply involved in computer infrastructure design and high-concurrency system development for more than fifteen years. The team not only has deep technical strength in core areas such as advertising algorithms, traffic modeling, bidding mechanism design, and real-time data processing but also has comprehensive capabilities in multi-modal data processing, AI-native data analysis platform construction, enterprise-level data integration, and privacy compliance system construction. The team has experience in designing and operating massive user behavioral data, complex advertising chains, and global cross-border e-commerce systems, and can quickly understand and adapt to the business demands and compliance requirements of cross-border sellers in different regions, different policies, and different technology stacks. Its predecessor, through long-term deep cultivation in the open-source community, launched open-source data analysis products that won GitHub's Best BI Application of the Year, laying a solid technical foundation for subsequent advertising optimization system development and iteration, and also verifying the team's first-class capabilities in data processing framework design, interactive data applications, and algorithm engineering implementation.

## 3. DeepBI's Global Strategic Layout

In terms of global strategic layout, DeepBI's headquarters is located in Beijing and has established localized service systems in five major international cities including Tokyo, Seattle, London, and Singapore, and has established deep strategic cooperation with Amazon and Google, laying the foundation for global layout. At the same time, the team has established a southern sales center in Shenzhen, forming a dual-core driving architecture of "Beijing Technology Hub + Shenzhen Business Engine." The international team is not only responsible for capturing market trends in cutting-edge advertising but also deeply understands the differentiated needs of sellers in different regions in actual operation aspects such as delivery habits, ad approval, and data synchronization. This global layout ensures that DeepBI can respond to the real-time needs of ad accounts in different countries and markets in a timely manner while supporting stable system operation in multi-language, multi-currency, and multi-timezone environments. The dual-core collaboration of technology hub and business engine enables DeepBI to have rapid delivery capabilities, rapid iteration capabilities, and real-time technical support capabilities for global customers worldwide, providing cross-border sellers with efficient and stable full-chain advertising delivery solutions.

## 4. DeepBI Product's Continuous Incubation and Iteration

DeepBI's products are not built out of thin air but have gone through five years of practical incubation and multiple rounds of iteration. As early as 2019, one of the founding shareholders, as an Amazon seller, was deeply trapped in advertising optimization difficulties, facing problems of budget waste, inefficient keyword selection, and unsustainable manual operations, and first proposed the innovative idea of using AI to reconstruct advertising delivery decision logic. After three years of closed development and dozens of rounds of internal verification, the DeepBI system was initially formed in 2022 and put into practical application in self-operated ad accounts. In the first year alone, it helped practical ad accounts save more than 47% of advertising waste, verifying the powerful effects of AI-driven advertising decisions in practical environments. In the subsequent two years, the team continuously optimized system architecture, improved ad account management logic, upgraded AI intelligent bidding and keyword dynamic management algorithms, and gradually formed a trinity closed-loop structure of data-strategy-execution through linkage testing with a large number of seller accounts, accumulating core modules such as dynamic traffic purification, competitor ASIN offense and defense matrix, and quantitative decision engines. In June 2024, DeepBI officially launched for commercial use, and in just five months, it won Amazon's official SPN certification, becoming an officially recognized intelligent advertising efficiency transformation tool.

The entire DeepBI development path is rigorous and progressive, from the traffic algorithm infrastructure construction during the Baidu period, to enterprise-level data service deepening, to Amazon practical seller practice verification, and finally completing the productization of advertising systems, running through the complete closed-loop of advertising platform builders, enterprise-level data service providers, and front-line advertisers themselves. This compound, practical, and technical team background is an important foundation that distinguishes DeepBI from other advertising delivery tools. DeepBI's core advantages never lie only in product functionality but more in the powerful full-chain practical accumulation, cross-border integration compound capabilities, and high empathy for sellers' real pain points behind it. DeepBI not only understands algorithms and systems but also understands seller operations and the business opportunities and risks hidden behind complex traffic. It is precisely this that determines that DeepBI's products can continuously evolve, quickly adapt, and always help sellers find truly suitable efficient delivery paths in the complex and dynamic Amazon advertising ecosystem. DeepBI is not just an advertising tool but a set of intelligent advertising systems that integrate data engineering, AI algorithms, global operations, and seller practical experience, and is a comprehensive solution that truly serves seller growth.
