# Why Excessive ACOS Control is Bad

In Amazon advertising operations, ACOS is an important metric for measuring advertising effectiveness. Many sellers often focus excessively on ACOS levels when starting ad delivery, even setting overly strict ACOS targets, trying to keep them at low levels. However, excessive ACOS control may cause sellers to overlook other more important operational metrics and even miss opportunities to boost sales. Correctly understanding and comprehensively viewing the significance of ACOS is crucial for sellers to achieve success in long-term operations.

## Why Excessive ACOS Control May Bring Negative Effects?

First, excessive ACOS control will affect exposure acquisition. In Amazon advertising, especially in SP ads, the intensity of competition determines ad costs and display positions. To keep ACOS at low levels, many sellers often choose to lower bids. While this approach can effectively reduce advertising costs, it will cause ad exposure and click volumes to drop sharply. Decreased exposure means products will have difficulty appearing before potential customers, directly affecting sales and ad conversion rates. In highly competitive categories, if ad bidding is too low, ads may not get display opportunities at all and may even be overshadowed by other sellers' ads.

Second, excessive ACOS control may limit advertising expansion and optimization space. An important feature of Amazon advertising is that through continuous delivery and data accumulation, sellers can gradually discover high-converting keywords and target audiences. However, if advertisers focus too much on ACOS control, they may reduce budgets for certain high-potential keywords, affecting long-term ad optimization and delivery effectiveness. In the early stages, especially during new product promotion, high ACOS is normal because new products need to quickly boost exposure and gain sales through advertising. High ACOS at this stage doesn't mean poor ad effectiveness but is a process of market education and brand recognition. If sellers excessively control ACOS at this time, they may limit ad delivery and miss conversion opportunities.

## How to Correctly View ACOS and Develop Reasonable Advertising Strategies?

ACOS is not only a metric for measuring advertising effectiveness; its level is also affected by factors such as the product itself, market competition, and seasonal fluctuations. Therefore, sellers need to comprehensively consider multiple factors, not just ACOS numbers. First, sellers should set reasonable ACOS targets based on their product profit margins. For high-profit margin products, sellers can appropriately accept higher ACOS because even with higher advertising investment, they can still ensure considerable profits. For low-profit margin products, sellers need to more carefully control ACOS to avoid excessive advertising costs affecting overall profitability.

Additionally, ACOS is just one metric for evaluating ad effectiveness. Sellers should also combine other important metrics to comprehensively judge ad delivery effectiveness. For example, CTR (click-through rate) and CVR (conversion rate) are also very important. Even with high ACOS, as long as CTR and CVR are good, it indicates high matching between ad delivery target audiences and good ad conversion efficiency. At this time, ACOS levels may not need excessive concern. Instead, budgets can be increased to expand ad exposure and conversion. Conversely, if ad click-through rates are low and conversion rates are poor, even with low ACOS, it indicates ads haven't effectively attracted target customers. In this case, ad content, keyword settings, and product pages need to be optimized to truly improve ad effectiveness.

## Comprehensive Ad Strategy Adjustment and Flexible ACOS View

Ultimately, excessive ACOS control practices will limit ad delivery effectiveness and optimization space. Therefore, sellers should flexibly adjust advertising strategies based on actual situations rather than relying solely on ACOS as the only decision-making basis. During ad delivery, sellers should gradually optimize keywords, adjust bidding strategies, and continuously adjust ad direction through data feedback. For example, when a keyword has high conversion rates, sellers can appropriately increase bidding for that keyword, increase budgets, and gain more traffic and exposure. When a keyword has low conversion rates, bidding for that keyword should be lowered or the keyword should be replaced. Meanwhile, sellers can also combine phased strategy adjustments with product lifecycle to reasonably set ACOS targets. During new product delivery, high ACOS is normal because exposure needs to be increased and sales gained through advertising. After products enter stable periods, ACOS targets can be appropriately adjusted, concentrating resources on high-converting ad campaigns and gradually reducing advertising costs to improve return on investment (ROI).

In summary, ACOS is not always better when lower. Excessive focus on ACOS may limit ad potential and effectiveness. Sellers should develop more flexible advertising strategies by comprehensively considering ACOS and other operational metrics based on different business needs and market environments. In this process, data-driven decision-making is key. Through continuous optimization of ad settings, increasing exposure and improving conversion rates, advertising effectiveness can ultimately be maximized, driving continuous growth of Amazon stores.
