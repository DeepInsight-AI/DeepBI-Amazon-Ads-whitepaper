# Ad Mode and Applicability Analysis

In Amazon's advertising operations, choosing appropriate ad modes is crucial. Ad modes directly determine whether sellers can effectively display products to potential buyers, affecting ad budget consumption efficiency and conversion rate improvement. Understanding the significance of ad mode and applicability analysis means sellers can develop appropriate ad delivery strategies based on product lifecycle, market competition, and their operational capabilities. This not only helps sellers reduce unnecessary ad waste but also improves ad return on investment, making ad delivery more refined. This chapter will analyze characteristics of different ad modes and explore their applicable scenarios so sellers can make optimal choices based on their business needs.

## Analysis of Auto or Manual Broad Mode Only

In Amazon advertising, automatic ads and manual broad match modes are usually common choices for many new sellers and budget-limited sellers. Through these modes, sellers can acquire traffic with lower bids and costs. Especially for sellers with tight budgets, automatic ads and manual broad match ads are effective ways to acquire cheap traffic.

### Characteristics of Auto and Manual Broad Modes

- **Automatic Ad Mode**: The system automatically matches relevant keywords and display positions for ads based on product titles, descriptions, categories, etc., without requiring sellers to manually set keywords. This mode helps new sellers save time and quickly launch ads, especially suitable for sellers without sufficient ad operation experience or data.
- **Manual Broad Match Mode**: Manual broad match in ads can cover multiple variants related to keywords, attracting more potential buyer clicks. Although this mode brings broader traffic, since matched terms may not fully align with actual product needs, when click-through rates are high, sellers need to pay attention to conversion rates to avoid wasting ineffective traffic.

### Applicable Situations

- **Individual Sellers/Profit-focused Sellers**: For sellers with limited funds or insufficient ad experience, automatic ads and manual broad match are good choices. These sellers usually hope to gain maximum exposure with lower ad costs and can quickly accumulate data using these modes when product market competition is intense. Automatic ad mode can help sellers gain initial traffic and clicks, while manual broad match mode allows sellers to flexibly adjust budgets and bidding strategies.
- **Responding to Market Competition Changes**: Sometimes market competitive environments change, causing certain keywords' cost per click (CPC) to rapidly increase. In these cases, relying solely on keyword ad delivery may no longer be cost-effective. For these situations, using automatic ads and manual broad match modes can help sellers quickly adapt to market changes and avoid wasting excessive ad budgets. Based on automatic ads, sellers can quickly adjust ad strategies, try different product categories, and avoid direct competition with large brands and sellers.

### Execution Strategies

- **Automatic Ad Traffic Acquisition**:
  - When using automatic ads, the system automatically matches relevant search terms and displays ads based on product information. Individual sellers can quickly acquire traffic this way without manually screening keywords. This strategy is especially suitable for sellers just starting operations because it saves significant time and energy and gradually identifies which keywords bring clicks and conversions through data accumulation.

- **Manual Broad Match Traffic Pool Expansion**:
  - Manual broad match ads can expand traffic pools and increase ad exposure. Through this mode, sellers can cover more long-tail keywords or related phrases. Although these keywords have less competition, their conversion potential is also significant. For individual sellers, manual broad match is a relatively low-cost way to acquire cheaper traffic, especially when core keyword competition is intense.

- **Dynamic Ad Performance Adjustment**:
  - In this mode, sellers need to regularly check ad performance, especially paying attention to which keywords bring higher click-through and conversion rates. If ad performance is poor, sellers should pay attention to market competition changes, possibly because competitors occupy ad positions or market trends change. In these cases, sellers can choose to adjust keywords, ad positions, or categories to adapt to new market environments and maximize traffic acquisition.

- **Budget Management**:
  - In auto and manual broad modes, budget control is crucial. Sellers should adjust budgets based on ad performance, ensuring high-performing keywords and ad positions receive sufficient budget support. Through flexible budget management, avoid ineffective ads consuming excessive funds. For individual sellers, reasonable budget control is particularly important to ensure optimal ad returns with limited resources.

- **Competition Analysis and Category Adjustment**:
  - Since individual sellers have limited budgets, they may encounter difficulties when competing with large company sellers. At this time, sellers can discover which categories have less competition or lower prices through analysis of market competition. By adjusting product categories or ad delivery strategies, sellers can avoid overly intense market competition, thereby reducing ad costs and improving conversion rates.

### Pros and Cons Analysis

- **Advantages**:
  - **Low-cost Traffic Acquisition**: Automatic ads and manual broad match can help sellers acquire traffic at lower costs.
  - **Adapt to Market Changes**: This mode is very suitable for sellers in intense market competition or with limited budgets.
  - **Save Time and Energy**: Especially automatic ads, sellers don't need to manually select keywords, ads can launch quickly and start collecting data.

  - Phrase match can help sellers flexibly adjust in changing markets, capture more potential customers, especially suitable for sellers with certain brand recognition and market experience. Through continuous optimization of phrase match keyword combinations, sellers can steadily expand ad influence.

- **Broad Match Strategy Execution**:
  - Broad match is the most scalable ad delivery method, suitable for sellers needing large-scale exposure increases. Broad match not only displays search terms matching target keywords but also displays related synonyms, variants, and extended terms. This method can help sellers gain traffic in broader ranges, especially suitable for new product stages, helping sellers quickly attract potential customers.
  - However, broad match also has challenges because it may bring large amounts of less relevant traffic, leading to low conversion rates. To avoid budget waste, sellers should regularly monitor broad match ad performance and use negative keyword strategies to exclude ineffective traffic.
  - In actual operations, sellers need to regularly analyze broad match ads, mining keywords that bring high conversions. By combining precise match and phrase match, sellers can effectively screen quality traffic while reducing ineffective traffic impact.

- **Combined Use of Precise Match, Phrase Match, and Broad Match**:
  - In this strategy, precise match, phrase match, and broad match are not used in isolation but complement each other. Sellers can first capture large amounts of potential customers through broad match, then refine through phrase match and precise match, ensuring ad delivery scope can highly align with customer needs.
  - Precise match provides efficient traffic control, phrase match helps expand traffic pools, and broad match can acquire customers on a large scale. Under this combined strategy, sellers can balance ad coverage and precision, ensuring overall ad effectiveness.
  - This multi-level, multi-dimensional strategy is suitable for sellers with certain ad budgets and capabilities for continuous optimization. Through refined adjustment of various match mode usage, sellers can improve ad effectiveness while maintaining low ACOS.

- **Regular Monitoring and Optimization**:
  - Precise match, phrase match, and broad match all require continuous monitoring and adjustment. Sellers should regularly check ad performance data, analyze click-through rates, conversion rates, and return on investment (ROI) of various keywords, timely adjusting bids and budgets.
  - A/B testing is also an important optimization method. Sellers can find optimal ad delivery strategies by comparing performance of different match modes on the same keywords. Additionally, sellers should flexibly adjust ad strategies based on market and competitive environment changes to maximize ad effectiveness.
