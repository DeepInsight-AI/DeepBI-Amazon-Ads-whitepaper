# Four Principles of the A9 Algorithm

On the Amazon platform, one of the keys to seller success is understanding and applying the A9 algorithm. The A9 algorithm is Amazon's core search algorithm, determining the display order of products in customer search results. Understanding the principles and operation methods of the A9 algorithm not only helps sellers optimize product pages and improve exposure but also enhances product conversion rates. The A9 algorithm has four main principles: **Search Indexing**, **Product Relevance**, **Past Search Patterns**, and **Past Traffic Patterns**. This article will detail these four principles to help sellers better understand how to improve product rankings on Amazon.

## Search Indexing

Search indexing is one of the most fundamental principles of the A9 algorithm. Simply put, search indexing refers to how Amazon processes and indexes product information so that the most relevant products can be quickly matched and displayed when customers search. The A9 algorithm organizes and stores information for all products on the platform through indexing, ensuring each product can be accurately identified and displayed when customers search.

### Construction of Search Index

Each product needs to establish a complete search index on the Amazon platform. Only after being indexed can products appear in search results. Search indexing includes not only common product information such as titles, keywords (Search Terms), bullet points, long descriptions, etc., but also more information sources. Specifically, the following content will be included in the A9 algorithm's search index:

- **Title**: Product titles are important components of search indexing. A9 will match products with customer search needs based on keywords in titles. Titles need to contain core keywords related to customer searches to ensure products can be displayed when customers search.
- **Bullet Points**: Bullet points are concise descriptions of product characteristics, helping customers quickly understand products. A9 analyzes keywords in bullet points and includes them in search indexing to improve product match with customer search needs.
- **Product Description**: Product descriptions provide more detailed information. A9 will deepen understanding of products through analyzing keywords and context in descriptions. Clear and precise descriptions help the A9 algorithm better match products with customer search intent.
- **Intended Use**: Intended use refers to the main functions of products and customer usage scenarios. By setting clear usage descriptions for products, sellers can help A9 better identify product positioning and display them to customers in need.
- **Product Type**: Product type is important information the A9 algorithm uses to classify and organize products. Product type information helps A9 determine which category products belong to, thereby including them in appropriate search results when customers search for related products.
- **Specific Style**: Specific style refers to product design style, appearance, or other details. Setting clear style labels for products helps improve product exposure in specific search scenarios.
- **Related Themes**: Products may be associated with certain specific themes, such as "eco-friendly," "sports," or "household items." A9 will help sellers gain more display opportunities in relevant search scenarios based on these theme tags.
- **A+ Pages**: A+ pages are brand pages provided by Amazon for displaying brand stories, product characteristics, and advantages. Content in A+ pages will be included in A9 search indexing, further improving brand and product exposure.

### Index Updates and Optimization

Product search indexes are not static; they continuously change as product information updates. Sellers need to regularly check and optimize product pages, ensuring all information is effectively indexed and highly aligned with customer search intent. Especially keyword selection and layout should be adjusted as market and customer needs change. Through continuous optimization of product information, sellers can ensure products have high relevance in the A9 algorithm, thereby improving rankings and exposure opportunities in search results.

## Past Search Patterns

The A9 algorithm assigns different weights to each product based on customers' past search behavior. This influence of historical search patterns is not limited to single search terms but broadly involves keywords, search terms, related products (such as "similar items" display), bundled products, etc., that customers use when searching. By recording customer search behavior, Amazon can accurately identify which keywords or search behaviors bring traffic to products, thereby helping adjust future rankings.

### Weight Differences in Historical Search Patterns

Different products receive different weights based on their historical performance. When a product receives large amounts of clicks, sales, and conversion rates over a period, it is considered a high-quality product and will receive more traffic and exposure in the A9 algorithm. Conversely, if a product's historical search performance is poor, A9 may reduce its exposure in search results until it regains sufficient positive interactions.

### Impact of Traffic Sources on Rankings

In historical search patterns, traffic sources have important influence on keyword ranking stability. Specifically, Amazon evaluates based on traffic sources, including:

- **Search Keywords**: When customers find products through certain keywords, A9 records this search behavior and judges keyword effectiveness based on historical data. If keywords can bring high conversion rates and sales, A9 will prioritize displaying that product.
- **Related Products**: After customers purchase a product, Amazon also recommends related products, which helps improve product exposure and sales. A9 analyzes traffic generated from recommended products and optimizes product rankings in similar product searches.
- **Bundle Sales**: When customers purchase bundled products, A9 records this behavior and increases display opportunities for related products. Through bundle sales, sellers can not only improve single product sales but also enhance rankings through bundled product combinations.

### Role of Long-tail Keywords

Long-tail keywords usually have lower search volume but can bring high conversion rates in specific search scenarios. The A9 algorithm improves core keyword rankings through long-tail keyword performance. The pulling effect of long-tail keywords is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

- **Long-tail Keyword Potential**: Although long-tail keywords have smaller search volumes, they can attract precise customer groups with higher conversion rates. By recording these high-conversion long-tail keywords, A9 can accumulate more exposure opportunities for core keywords.
- **Synergistic Effect of Long-tail and Core Keywords**: When a long-tail keyword brings high conversion, A9 will associate this keyword with core keywords, further improving core keyword rankings.

### Factors Affecting Keyword Ranking Stability

The A9 algorithm comprehensively considers the following factors to stabilize keyword rankings:

1. **Sales under Keywords**: The more sales under a keyword, the stronger A9 considers the relevance between the keyword and product, therefore improving the keyword's ranking.
2. **Conversion Rate under Keywords**: Higher conversion rates indicate better match between keywords and products, so A9 will prioritize displaying that product.
3. **Profit Contribution by Keywords**: Product pricing and profits also affect A9 algorithm rankings. High-priced products bring higher commissions and shipping fees to Amazon, therefore having higher weight in the A9 algorithm.

These factors complement each other, and A9 continuously adjusts and optimizes keyword rankings through this data, thereby improving product exposure and sales.

## Past Traffic Patterns

The past traffic patterns principle refers to Amazon optimizing product rankings based on product historical traffic sources. Specifically, the A9 algorithm analyzes traffic sources when customers visit product pages over a period and adjusts rankings based on traffic source quality and quantity.

### Classification of Traffic Sources

Amazon's traffic sources can be mainly divided into the following types, with each type having different impacts on product rankings:

1. **Organic Traffic**: Organic traffic refers to traffic from customers entering product pages through natural search. Since this traffic comes from customers' active search and has high relevance, it has the greatest impact on rankings.
2. **Ad Traffic**: Ad traffic refers to traffic brought through Amazon advertising (such as SP ads, SB ads, SD ads). Ad traffic can quickly improve product exposure and sales, but its effectiveness depends on ad click-through rates, conversion rates, and bidding strategies. Compared to organic traffic, ad traffic has lower conversion rates, so it has smaller impact on rankings but still plays a positive promotional role.
3. **Off-Site Traffic**: Traffic introduced through Amazon's off-site channels (such as through Amazon Associates or other promotional channels) also affects product rankings. Amazon tracks off-site traffic effectiveness through Amazon Attribution tools, helping sellers improve product exposure through off-site channels.
4. **URL Traffic**: URL traffic refers to traffic entering product pages through direct URL clicks. Although this traffic volume is small, if customers make purchases under this traffic, the A9 algorithm will consider this traffic to have positive impact on product rankings.
5. **Amazon B2B Traffic**: This traffic comes from Amazon's B2B platform (sales channels for business customers). When B2B traffic brings high sales, A9 will consider it an effective traffic source and have certain impact on product rankings.

### Impact of Traffic Sources on Rankings

Different traffic sources have different degrees of impact on rankings. The following is an analysis of traffic source impact on the A9 algorithm:

- **Organic Traffic**: Organic traffic is considered the most valuable traffic, directly improving product rankings. The A9 algorithm determines product rankings by judging the match between product organic traffic and customer search needs.
- **Ad Traffic**: Although ad traffic usually has lower conversion rates, by improving ad exposure, sellers can gain more clicks and sales, which can also indirectly improve product rankings.
- **Off-Site Traffic**: The role of off-site traffic is to introduce new customers, improve product exposure, and indirectly drive rankings through sales growth.
- **URL Traffic**: URL traffic plays a supplementary role in improving product exposure and conversion but has relatively small impact.
- **B2B Traffic**: If products perform well in B2B channels, A9 will also consider this traffic source and include it in ranking calculations.

## Product Relevance

On the Amazon platform, product relevance is an important factor determining product rankings in search results. One of the core goals of the A9 algorithm is to ensure that products most aligned with user search intent are displayed to users. Product relevance is not just a keyword matching issue but also involves product information completeness, quality, and match with customer needs. Therefore, to improve product relevance, sellers need to optimize from multiple aspects.

### Core of Product Relevance Principle

The core of the product relevance principle is: **Let Amazon understand what you're selling and ensure your products can highly match customer search intent**. In other words, product relevance is achieved through comprehensive analysis of multiple factors to ensure that when customers search for certain keywords, products are the most relevant options. The A9 algorithm evaluates product relevance through the following aspects:

- **Keyword Matching**: When customers search for certain keywords, the A9 algorithm judges product relevance to search terms by analyzing keywords in product titles, descriptions, bullet points, etc.
- **Completeness and Accuracy of Product Information**: Not only keyword matching, A9 also analyzes product information completeness and accuracy. The more comprehensive product information is, the better Amazon can identify product match with customer needs.
- **Customer Behavior Data**: Such as click-through rates, purchase behavior, reviews, etc. A9 will further evaluate product relevance based on this behavioral data to improve rankings.

### Core Factors Affecting Product Relevance

1. **Conversion Rate**

Conversion rate refers to the proportion of customers who ultimately complete purchases after clicking on product ads or products in search results. Conversion rate is an important basis for the A9 algorithm to judge product relevance. High conversion rates indicate high match between products and customer needs, so Amazon will give products higher rankings based on this data.

- **Advantages of High Conversion Rate Products**: When customers show interest in a product and complete purchases, A9 considers the product meets customer needs and has high relevance. In contrast, products with lower conversion rates are considered to have lower match with customer needs, thereby affecting rankings.
- **Optimization Strategies to Improve Conversion Rates**: Optimizing product pages, improving product description quality, adding high-quality images, adjusting pricing strategies, improving customer service, etc., are all effective means to improve conversion rates.

2. **Match Relevance**

The A9 algorithm not only relies on direct matching between products and search terms but also considers semantic matching between keywords. For example, when customers search "usb charger," if a product title contains "usb charging cable," even though these terms are not exactly the same, A9 will consider them highly relevant.

- **Keyword Match Degree**: A9 analyzes keyword order, word variations, and synonyms to ensure the most relevant products are displayed in search results.
- **Semantic Matching**: The A9 algorithm increasingly focuses on semantic understanding rather than just precise keyword matching. Through context analysis, A9 can understand customer search intent and match relevant products.

3. **Customer Satisfaction and Retention**

Customer satisfaction directly affects product relevance, especially in competitive markets where customer purchase behavior greatly affects product rankings. High satisfaction and repurchase rates indicate that products truly meet customer needs, so they will be considered more relevant by the A9 algorithm.

- **Repurchase Rate**: If customers purchase a product and repeat purchases, it indicates the product has high appeal and value to customers. A9 will evaluate product relevance based on repurchase data.
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Customer reviews and ratings are another important factor in product relevance. Products with many good reviews and high ratings usually mean high customer satisfaction, so these products will get bonus points in relevance.

4. **Expected Conversion Rate (ECR)**

Expected conversion rate (ECR) for new products is a "predictive" evaluation by the A9 algorithm for new products. Since new products lack historical sales data, A9 will predict their conversion rates based on other factors such as repurchases, add-to-cart rates, wish lists, product reviews, etc., thereby affecting their relevance scores.

- **Repeat Purchase**: Customer repurchase behavior can improve expected conversion rates for new products, enabling new products to achieve higher rankings in search results.
- **Add to Cart Rate**: Higher add-to-cart rates indicate strong customer purchase intent for products, which is crucial for improving expected conversion rates for new products.
- **Wish List**: Customers adding products to wish lists or marking them as gifts indicates their purchase interest in products. The A9 algorithm will adjust new product relevance scores based on these behaviors.
- **Q&A Interaction**: Q&A interactions on product pages can reflect customer attention and interest in products, increasing relevance scores.
