# Main Factors Affecting the A9 Algorithm

The core goal of the A9 algorithm is to display the most relevant and conversion-likely products to customers. To optimize rankings, sellers need to comprehensively understand the core elements of the A9 algorithm. Based on practice and testing, A9 algorithm ranking factors can be summarized into the following three core dimensions:

1. **Relevance: Meeting Customer Search Needs**
2. **Conversion Rate: Stimulating Customer Purchase Behavior**
3. **Satisfaction and Repurchase Rate: Delivering Ultimate Customer Experience**

## Relevance

In Amazon's A9 algorithm, relevance is one of the most important influencing factors. It determines whether products can appear in customer search results, directly affecting product exposure and rankings. The A9 algorithm ensures that products most aligned with customer needs and search intent are displayed to them through multi-dimensional analysis of product information. Relevance not only depends on the match between products and search terms but also includes the completeness and accuracy of product information. Therefore, the A9 algorithm comprehensively considers multiple factors to evaluate the match between products and customer search intent, thereby determining product display rankings in search results. Specifically, when measuring relevance, the A9 algorithm focuses on the following key aspects:

### 1. **Product Title**

The product title is one of the primary factors the A9 algorithm uses to judge relevance. The title is the first information customers see, and it must be concise and accurately reflect the product's core characteristics. A title containing relevant keywords ensures customers can quickly find target products when searching. Therefore, sellers should ensure keywords are reasonably arranged in product titles, making them both attractive and accurately expressing product functions, uses, and advantages.

### 2. **Bullet Points**

Bullet points are concise product introductions on product pages, usually containing key product characteristics, advantages, and selling points. The A9 algorithm judges the match between products and customer search intent by analyzing keywords in these descriptions. Reasonable keyword layout and clear display of product selling points help improve product relevance to search intent and increase customer click-through and conversion rates.

### 3. **Product Description**

Product descriptions are usually more detailed, providing in-depth information about product usage, functions, advantages, etc. The A9 algorithm analyzes keywords and context in product descriptions to evaluate product relevance to search terms. To improve relevance, sellers need to accurately and comprehensively display product characteristics in descriptions while ensuring keywords are closely aligned with customer search intent.

### 4. **Brand Name and Manufacturer Part Number**

The importance of brand names and manufacturer part numbers in the A9 algorithm cannot be ignored. Through brand names, A9 can identify product industry affiliation and brand background, while manufacturer part numbers help accurately identify products. For customers with brand preferences, the existence of brand names and numbers can improve brand search exposure. Therefore, accurately filling in brand names and manufacturer part numbers in product pages not only helps improve product relevance but also increases brand awareness.

### 5. **Category and Subcategory**

Each product must select the correct category and subcategory, which is crucial for the A9 algorithm to determine product display positions. Selecting wrong categories and subcategories will lead to product misclassification, preventing them from appearing in relevant searches. Only by selecting correct categories can A9 match products with corresponding customer needs and display products in search results. Therefore, sellers should ensure selecting the most relevant categories for products and precisely set subcategories when publishing.

### 6. **Search Terms**

Search terms are important basis for the A9 algorithm to judge product relevance. The higher the relevance between customer-entered search terms and products, the greater the opportunity for product display. Sellers need to accurately select keywords related to products in backend search term settings, ensuring A9 can identify products based on these keywords and judge their match with customer needs. By using broad match and exact match keywords, sellers can improve product exposure and search rankings.

### 7. **Product Specifications**

Product technical specifications, dimensions, colors, materials, and other information significantly impact the A9 algorithm's relevance judgment. Clear, detailed, and accurate specification descriptions help improve product match with customer search needs. When customers search, A9 will display products meeting requirements through analysis of product specifications. Therefore, when setting product specifications, sellers need to ensure specification items are complete and accurate so A9 can better understand and display products.

## Conversion Rate

Conversion rate is one of the important considerations of the A9 algorithm, directly affecting product rankings in search results. Conversion rate refers to the proportion of customers who actually place orders after clicking on products. Higher conversion rates indicate that the product has received more customer recognition and can effectively meet customer needs. The key to improving conversion rates is optimizing product pages to make it easier for customers to make purchase decisions. The following are nine factors affecting conversion rates:

### 1. **Listing Presentation**

Listing presentation refers to how products are displayed on Amazon, including titles, bullet points, images, and product descriptions. Good listing presentation can attract customer attention and generate interest in products. Specifically:

- **Title**: Concise and clear, containing keywords.
- **Bullet Points**: Highlighting product advantages and selling points.
- **Product Description**: Detailed introduction of product characteristics, usage methods, advantages, etc.

Careful design of all these elements can improve product visibility, thereby increasing the probability of customer clicks and eventual purchases.

### 2. **Listing Completeness**

Listing completeness refers to whether all relevant fields are filled completely and whether content is detailed and accurate. Amazon evaluates product priority in search results based on the completeness of product information. Complete listings help the A9 algorithm better understand products and match customer search intent, thereby improving rankings. Specifically, sellers need to ensure:

- Completeness of product titles, descriptions, specifications, brands, categories, etc.
- Accurate backend search term settings covering relevant keywords.

### 3. **Page Stay and Bounce Rate**

Page stay time refers to how long customers stay on product pages, while bounce rate is the proportion of customers who leave after browsing the page. Longer stay times usually indicate high customer interest in products, while lower bounce rates mean customers can get effective product information when browsing pages, making them more likely to complete purchases.

- **Long Stay Time**: Customers have high interest in products and can better understand products.
- **Low Bounce Rate**: Customers haven't found more attractive products, indicating page design is appealing.

By optimizing product pages, improving customer stay time and reducing bounce rates, sellers can improve conversion rates and optimize A9 rankings.

### 4. **Parent-Child Products**

Parent-child product structure refers to grouping similar but different variants (such as colors, sizes, styles, etc.) under the same product page. This structure can improve conversion rates because customers can find all variants on one page, increasing purchase flexibility. For example, if customers are unsatisfied with a T-shirt's color, they can choose different colors or sizes without jumping to other product pages.

### 5. **Price**

Price has a huge impact on conversion rates. The A9 algorithm evaluates whether product prices are competitive based on market competition and customer expectations. Appropriate pricing strategies can improve customer purchase intent. Prices that are too high will reduce conversion rates, while prices that are too low may affect customer judgment of product quality. Sellers need to find reasonable price balance points to attract customers and facilitate purchases.

### 6. **Image Size and Quality**

Images are important channels for customers to understand products. High-quality images can attract customer attention and stimulate their purchase interest. Amazon requires product images to have high resolution and clearly display product details. Images should include at least main images, multi-angle product displays, and usage scenario images. Quality images can significantly improve conversion rates and directly affect A9 rankings.

### 7. **Q&A Interaction**

The Q&A section on product pages helps improve conversion rates. When customers ask questions and receive answers, these interactions help eliminate customer doubts and promote purchases. The A9 algorithm evaluates Q&A section interactions, and high-quality Q&A can enhance product credibility, improve customer trust in products, and thereby increase conversion rates.

### 8. **Reviews**

The quantity and quality of product reviews directly affect conversion rates. Good reviews can increase customer trust and encourage them to complete purchases. Review quality depends not only on quantity but also on review content and customer feedback. Amazon encourages sellers to obtain authentic reviews by providing quality products and services, while fake reviews and false reviews may lead to product ranking declines.

### 9. **Product Ranking**

Product ranking directly affects its exposure and conversion rates. The A9 algorithm determines product rankings by analyzing comprehensive performance (such as sales, conversion rates, reviews, etc.). Higher product rankings mean more exposure, thereby improving conversion rates. Sellers should continuously optimize product pages, increase sales, and pay attention to ranking performance to ensure favorable positions in search results.

## Satisfaction and Repurchase Rate

Satisfaction and repurchase rates are another important factor in the A9 algorithm. Improving customer satisfaction not only enhances short-term sales but also strengthens brand loyalty, bringing long-term benefits. The A9 algorithm particularly values satisfaction and repurchase rates because they directly affect customer repurchase frequency and brand value.

### 1. **Order Defect Rate (ODR)**

Order Defect Rate (ODR) is an important indicator Amazon uses to measure seller service quality. It reflects the proportion of problems when sellers handle orders, such as customer complaints, refunds, returns, etc. If the order defect rate is too high, Amazon will downgrade sellers' products and stores, affecting product rankings.

Sellers should strengthen order management, avoid delays in shipping, product quality issues, etc., to ensure low order defect rates and improve customer satisfaction.

### 2. **Perfect Order Percentage**

Perfect order percentage refers to the proportion of all orders that meet customer requirements without any problems. High perfect order rates mean sellers can efficiently and accurately meet customer needs and provide quality services. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also increases repurchase rates, thereby improving product A9 rankings.

### 3. **Inventory Performance Index (IPI)**

Inventory Performance Index (IPI) measures seller performance in inventory management. High IPI indicates sellers can effectively manage inventory, ensure products are not out of stock, and replenish supplies promptly. Insufficient inventory will cause customers to lose purchase interest and affect customer shopping experience. Ensuring good inventory management can increase customer satisfaction and drive repurchases.

### 4. **Order Processing Speed**

Order processing speed refers to the time from customer order to shipment. Fast order processing can improve customer satisfaction and reduce negative reviews due to shipping delays. The A9 algorithm will incorporate this factor into ranking considerations, prioritizing sellers who can efficiently process orders.

### 5. **Negative Seller Feedback**

Negative feedback received by sellers directly affects their rankings in the A9 algorithm. Negative feedback usually comes from customer dissatisfaction, possibly due to product quality, service attitude, delivery, etc. Sellers should try to avoid negative feedback, resolve customer issues promptly, and reduce customer complaints through quality service and positive communication.
