# Traditional Amazon Advertising Strategies for Beginners

For sellers who have just entered the Amazon platform, advertising operations are often an unfamiliar and challenging field. Initial focus areas usually center on the following aspects:

- **Limited Ad Budget**: Limited initial capital investment - how to achieve maximum ad effectiveness with limited budgets?
- **Unclear Product Positioning**: New products launched without sufficient sales data - how to determine which keywords and ad strategies are most effective?
- **Difficulty Choosing Ad Types**: Facing multiple ad types (such as automatic ads, manual ads, brand ads, etc.) - how to choose the most suitable ad format for your products?
- **Conversion Rates and Ad Effectiveness**: How to measure ad delivery effectiveness? How to improve ad conversion rates and reduce ad costs?

To address these concerns, new sellers need to develop scientific and systematic advertising operation strategies to achieve maximum return on ad investment.

## Key Focus Areas for New Product Period Ad Operations

When launching new products on Amazon, the core goal of ad operations is to ensure products can successfully enter the market and gain sufficient exposure and conversion. In the new product period, due to lack of historical sales data, sellers need to verify product market acceptance and achieve positive profit growth through effective ad strategies. Reasonable ad strategies not only help new products quickly gain traffic but also optimize ad effectiveness through precise data analysis, ultimately achieving long-term brand and product promotion.

### 1. Traffic Acquisition and Conversion Monitoring

- **Keyword Selection:**

Keyword selection is the first step in ad delivery and a very crucial link. For new products, choosing keywords highly relevant to products is the premise of ad success. Sellers should screen the most relevant keywords based on product characteristics, target customer groups, and market demand. Through keyword tools, sellers can find high-potential long-tail keywords and ensure ads can reach potential customers. Keyword selection not only relates to ad exposure but also directly affects ad click-through and conversion rates.

**Exact Match Keywords**: Exact match keywords help ads precisely connect with customer needs, especially suitable for new product periods, allowing ads to display to customers with the strongest purchase intent.

**Broad Match Keywords**: Broad match keywords can help new product ads cover larger traffic pools, especially suitable for early new product stages, allowing products to gain broad exposure and accumulate click data.

- **Ad Budget Setting:**

New product ad budget setting requires special caution. Excessive budgets may lead to unnecessary waste, while insufficient budgets may result in inadequate ad effectiveness. Therefore, reasonable ad budget setting is crucial. It's recommended to adjust budgets based on product profit margins and market competition. In the early new product period, ad budgets should be relatively conservative, gradually adjusting based on ad effectiveness. If new product conversion is good, budgets can be moderately increased to improve exposure and click volume.

- **Conversion Rate Analysis:**

During ad delivery, conversion rates are important indicators for measuring ad effectiveness. New product period conversion rates are usually low due to lack of sufficient market recognition and user trust. Therefore, sellers need to closely monitor ad click-through and conversion rates and adjust strategies based on data. For example, when a certain keyword's conversion rate is low, sellers can adjust that keyword's bid or pause that keyword's ad delivery. Through conversion rate analysis, sellers can quickly identify which keywords perform poorly, avoiding unnecessary ad cost waste.

### 2. Profit Contribution Analysis

- **High-Profit Products Priority:**

In the new product period, ad delivery should prioritize high-profit margin products for promotion. This is because early ad delivery may take a long time to achieve expected returns, and choosing high-profit products can help sellers recover costs faster and improve return on investment (ROI). With limited ad budgets, prioritizing those high-profit products can better ensure overall ad delivery effectiveness.

- **Pricing Strategy:**

Pricing strategy is crucial for new product ad delivery. Reasonable pricing not only ensures products have market competitiveness but also ensures products can bring reasonable profits after ad investment. In the new product period, sellers should comprehensively consider product costs, market prices, and competitor prices to set prices, ensuring profitability after covering ad costs, Amazon commissions, logistics, and other expenses.

- **Cost Control:**

Controlling ad costs is one of the key factors for successful ad delivery. New product period ad delivery needs special attention to cost control, avoiding profit decline due to excessive ad costs. Sellers can regularly check ad reports, analyze which ad campaigns perform well and which don't bring expected conversions, then timely optimize or pause poorly performing ads and reasonably allocate ad budgets.

## Mainstream Ad Strategies for New Sellers

Amazon, as the world's largest e-commerce platform, has huge market traffic and potential customer groups. On this highly competitive platform, new sellers face multiple choices and strategies, especially in ad delivery. Reasonable ad strategies can help sellers quickly gain exposure, improve conversion rates, and reduce ad costs. However, due to the complexity of the ad system, many new sellers often get confused when choosing ad strategies. In this section, we will analyze several common ad strategies in detail and explore how new sellers should choose and apply these ad strategies.

### 1. Automatic Ads First

**Operation Method:**

New sellers in the early stages of opening stores usually don't have much data about keyword performance, so automatic ads are usually the most common ad delivery method. The system automatically matches relevant search terms based on product information (such as titles, descriptions, keywords, etc.) and automatically delivers to relevant ad positions. Sellers don't need to choose or set specific keywords in advance; the system automatically handles keyword matching and ad position selection.

**Advantages:**

- **Quick Launch**: Automatic ads can launch and run in a short time, helping new sellers quickly push products to market. Especially for new sellers lacking experience, automatic ads greatly reduce preparation time before ad delivery.
- **Data Accumulation**: Through automatic ad delivery, new sellers can quickly accumulate relevant data (such as click-through rates, conversion rates, etc.), providing valuable data basis for subsequent ad optimization. This data helps sellers understand which keywords and ad positions bring traffic and sales, providing support for manual ad fine-tuning.
- **High Adaptability**: Automatic ad systems have strong adaptability, automatically adjusting based on market changes, search trends, and consumer behavior. When certain keyword demand increases, the system automatically increases display frequency; if certain keywords perform poorly, the system also automatically reduces budget delivery.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Weak Control**: Although automatic ads can launch quickly, sellers cannot precisely control specific keywords, ad positions, or delivery strategies. For sellers wanting precise operations, automatic ads' control capabilities are very limited.
- **Uneven Budget Consumption**: Due to lack of seller intervention in automatic ad settings, certain poorly performing keywords may consume large budgets. Sellers have difficulty controlling ad budget flow, sometimes leading to budgets favoring certain inefficient keywords, wasting ad funds.

**Recommendations:**

For most new sellers, automatic ads as the first choice for initial ad strategies can help sellers quickly enter the market and accumulate data. However, it's worth noting that automatic ads have weak control capabilities, so sellers need to gradually transition to manual ads after accumulating certain data to better optimize ad effectiveness and fine-manage.

### 2. Manual Ad Fine Management

**Operation Method:**

After accumulating sufficient data through automatic ads in the early ad delivery period, new sellers can gradually transition to manual ads. In this approach, sellers can manually choose and manage keywords, bids, ad positions, and other strategies. Manual ads allow sellers to set bids for specific keywords and optimize ad delivery based on data performance.

**Advantages:**

- **Precise Control**: Manual ads give sellers precise control over ad delivery. Sellers can increase bids for well-performing keywords to gain more display opportunities while reducing budget allocation for poorly performing keywords. This way, sellers can maximize budget usage efficiency and improve ad conversion rates and ROI.
- **Large Optimization Space**: Manual ads provide more optimization space for sellers. Sellers can make more flexible and diverse adjustments based on real-time ad data. For example, they can increase delivery for high-conversion keywords, optimize inefficient ad positions, or even adjust keyword matching methods (exact match, phrase match, broad match, etc.) to maximize ad effectiveness.
- **Precise Delivery**: Manual ads' precise control means sellers can choose specific ad positions (such as top of search results pages, product pages, etc.) to display ads, ensuring ad delivery relevance and precision, thereby improving product exposure and click-through rates.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Complex Operation**: Compared to automatic ads, manual ad setup and management are relatively complex, requiring sellers to have certain ad operation knowledge and experience. New sellers lacking sufficient ad operation experience may feel difficulty and pressure.
- **High Data Requirements**: Manual ad optimization requires sufficient data support, especially regarding keyword click-through rates, conversion rates, and other indicators. New products may need a long time to accumulate sufficient data for effective optimization due to lack of historical sales data. Therefore, manual ads require longer time accumulation and practice for new sellers.

**Recommendations for New Sellers:**

After accumulating certain ad data, new sellers should gradually transition to manual ads. This is because manual ads can help sellers fine-manage ad budgets, choose keywords, and optimize delivery strategies. However, new sellers need to spend time learning and understanding manual ad operation methods and continuously optimize based on ad data.
