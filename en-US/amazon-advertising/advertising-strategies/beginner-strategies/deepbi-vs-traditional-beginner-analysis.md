# DeepBI's Beginner Strategy VS Traditional Beginner Strategy

In Amazon advertising operations, especially for new sellers, choosing appropriate ad strategies is crucial. Although automatic ads and manual ads are common mainstream strategies, they have certain limitations. DeepBI's intelligent ad delivery strategy breaks through these bottlenecks through its unique algorithms and reverse optimization mechanisms, providing new sellers with more precise and efficient advertising operation solutions. The following will detail DeepBI's ad strategy advantages and compare them with traditional beginner ad strategies in the market, analyzing the benefits and improvements they bring.

## Challenges and Shortcomings of Traditional Ad Strategies

In traditional ad delivery, especially for new sellers, common strategies often rely on combinations of automatic ads and manual ads. This approach sometimes faces several key problems:

### 1.1 Keyword Selection Difficulty and Low Efficiency

New sellers usually rely on industry experience or competitor keywords to choose target keywords. Although this method can gain certain traffic, keyword selection is often based on experience estimation, lacking data support. Moreover, Amazon's keyword database is vast and dynamically changing, and buyer search needs often change. Relying solely on subjective judgment and limited historical data easily misses potential high-conversion keywords.

### 1.2 Inefficient Consumption of High-Competition Keywords

In initial delivery, core keywords often have intense competition. New sellers may blindly enter high-traffic core keyword markets, but these keywords have high costs. Especially for budget-limited sellers, forcibly competing for these high-competition keywords often leads to rapid ad budget consumption with unsatisfactory results.

### 1.3 Neglect of Long-tail Keywords

Although long-tail keywords usually have high conversion rates, due to high mining difficulty and large quantities, many new sellers lack sufficient capability to screen and manage long-tail keywords. Traditional keyword delivery modes often overlook this, leading to single ad traffic and lack of effective coverage of segmented markets.

## Unique Advantages of DeepBI Ad Strategies

DeepBI's ad strategy breaks through traditional limitations through its four-layer funnel optimization model, providing a more intelligent and precise ad delivery method. Compared to traditional ad delivery strategies, DeepBI has significant advantages in the following aspects:

### 2.1 Automated Traffic Screening, Eliminating Human Keyword Selection Limitations

One of DeepBI's core advantages is helping new sellers avoid keyword selection difficulties in traditional ad delivery through intelligent automated traffic screening mechanisms. In DeepBI's ad delivery process, the exploration layer's ASIN ads quickly acquire relevant traffic through competitor pages and search results pages, avoiding sellers' over-reliance on subjective experience for keyword selection. Through precise ASIN ads and broad matching, DeepBI can screen potential high-value traffic in a short time and continuously improve traffic quality and precision through reverse optimization mechanisms (keyword feedback). This mechanism reduces keyword selection difficulty, enabling new sellers to find high-potential traffic with less time and cost.

### 2.2 Precise Market Penetration Through Competitor Traffic

Traditional strategies often face inefficient consumption when core keywords have intense competition, while DeepBI avoids direct competition with strong competitors on core keywords through precise competitor traffic interception. By placing ads below competitor detail pages and search results pages, DeepBI helps sellers precisely penetrate competitor traffic pools, maximizing conversion rates. For example, if a seller's "portable juicer cup" is similar to mainstream competitors, DeepBI will appear on competitor detail pages through precise competitor ASIN ad delivery. When potential customers browse competitors, DeepBI's ads will appear at the bottom or related ad positions, attracting customer clicks and conversion.

### 2.3 Reverse Optimization and Dynamic Data Feedback Mechanism

DeepBI's ad delivery is not just simple keyword selection and matching but includes a powerful dynamic data feedback mechanism. After collecting preliminary data through ASIN ads in the exploration layer, the system feeds this data back to subsequent precision and volume expansion layers to further screen high-conversion keywords and ASINs, gradually improving ad precision. This mechanism is particularly important in new sellers' ad operations. Traditional ad delivery requires sellers to manually analyze which keywords bring conversions, while DeepBI helps sellers optimize ads more efficiently through automated analysis and data feedback, maximizing ad investment returns.

### 2.4 Bidirectional Optimization of Long-tail and Core Keywords

DeepBI particularly focuses on long-tail keyword discovery and precise control of core keywords. In the exploration layer, the system covers more long-tail keywords through broad matching and phrase matching, while in the precision layer, DeepBI removes inefficient traffic and focuses on high-conversion core keywords. This bidirectional optimization ensures ad delivery diversity and precision, covering broad traffic while ensuring efficient traffic stability. Traditional keyword delivery often insufficiently values long-tail keywords, leading to ad effectiveness singularity. DeepBI helps new sellers discover high-potential long-tail keywords in a short time through intelligent screening, improving ad coverage and conversion rates.
