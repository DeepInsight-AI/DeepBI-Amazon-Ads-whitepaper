# DeepBI's Beginner Strategy: Exploration Layer Discovery of Converting Keywords and Subsequent Feedback

## How DeepBI Finds Precise Traffic

### Disadvantages and Limitations of Keyword Delivery Mode:

In the increasingly complex Amazon advertising ecosystem with intensifying competition, traditional keyword delivery modes face more and more bottlenecks and limitations. These problems not only increase ad delivery trial and error costs but also seriously affect ad return on investment for both new sellers and even mature sellers. Specific manifestations include the following aspects:

1. **Keyword Selection Mainly Based on Industry Experience or Estimation**: In keyword delivery mode, sellers often choose keywords based on limited industry understanding, historical data, or competitor keywords. Due to Amazon's vast keyword database and complex, dynamically changing buyer search behavior, subjectively judged keyword selection is difficult to comprehensively cover users' real search paths. More importantly, some keywords may appear related to products on the surface but may not actually be core purchase words for that product, ultimately leading to low exposure or poor click-through rates. For example, selling "children's sports water bottles" and choosing the keyword "water bottle" for ad delivery. But when users actually search for "water bottle," they may need office water bottles, glass water bottles, or thermos bottles, which don't match the seller's product positioning, leading to traffic entry but extremely low conversion rates and massive ad budget waste.

2. **Demand Matching Logic May Be Unreasonable**: The same keyword may correspond to multiple demands, ultimately leading to high ad exposure and click-through rates but low conversion rates. Choosing keywords based solely on experience easily attracts mismatched traffic, leading to ad budget waste. For example, a seller selling "splash-proof Bluetooth headphones" chooses to deliver ads for the keyword "waterproof headphones." While seemingly highly relevant, users may actually be searching for fully waterproof headphones suitable for swimming. This demand mismatch leads to many users clicking ads only to find products don't meet expectations, then leaving or abandoning purchases, ultimately forming high-click, low-conversion situations with soaring ad ACoS.

3. **Intense Core Keyword Competition and Insufficient Long-tail Keyword Coverage**: Keyword traffic follows the obvious "80/20 rule," where a small number of core keywords occupy the vast majority of traffic. However, competition behind these core keywords is extremely fierce, especially for budget-limited new sellers. Forcibly entering head keyword traffic pools often leads to price wars or inefficient consumption dilemmas. Meanwhile, although long-tail keywords have high conversion potential, their mining difficulty is extremely high, with large quantities and high manual management costs, easily causing delivery gaps. Keyword delivery mode creates a dilemma for Amazon sellers in ad operations: on one hand, a small number of core keywords occupy large traffic, whether to invest heavily in ad costs to compete with many competitors or choose to spend significant time costs selecting and mining long-tail keywords with small traffic, or do nothing and be eliminated by the market. For example, a seller selling "home massage chairs" faces head keyword "massage chair" with CPC as high as $6, with competitors being large brands that almost monopolize search homepage. New sellers blindly competing for these keywords will almost see no orders in the short term while daily ad budgets are rapidly consumed. When trying to mine long-tail keywords like "portable home small massage chair," they often miss some high-potential long-tail keywords due to manual selection limitations, failing to effectively penetrate segmented markets.

### DeepBI's Strategy and Principles for Choosing ASIN Delivery Mode:

To address the above pain points, DeepBI proposes a systematic ASIN ad traffic interception and optimization strategy. Mainly choosing to deliver product ads from two positions:

1. **Ad positions below competitor detail pages**: Ad positions below competitor detail pages are one of the particularly crucial traffic entry points in Amazon's advertising system. The logic of this ad position is that when users browse competitor products, Amazon will recommend ads related to this product (the competitor) at the bottom of the page, providing excellent opportunities for precise traffic interception. **If the advertised product is superior to competitors in comprehensive aspects, it can achieve competitor traffic interception!** For example, a seller's advertised product is a "portable mini juicer cup," with main image showing the product is lightweight and portable, supports USB charging, and is 20% cheaper than competitors. When this ad appears on competitor detail pages, users compare and find this product is cheaper and more convenient, likely to be successfully "intercepted" and converted.

2. **Ad positions on keyword search results pages**: Ad positions displayed after users actively search, this position compared to detail page ads, **users have stronger purchase intent and more precise traffic.** One of DeepBI system's core advantages is that when sellers capture search results page traffic through ASIN ads, **orders can automatically be attributed to search keywords.** This means that after sellers enter the market through ASIN delivery in the early stages, they can gradually collect which keywords actually generated conversion orders, forming sustainable precise delivery keyword pools. The core logic lies in the **ASIN Ads â†’ Keyword Feedback Path**: through ASIN ads penetrating low-competition scenarios, gradually mining real high-value keywords that can bring orders (converting keywords), providing data support for later keyword ads. For example, a seller selling "portable foldable travel backpacks" places competitor ASIN ads, with ads appearing on competitor search results pages. When users search "lightweight travel backpack" and click the ad to place an order, DeepBI system automatically attributes this order to the keyword "lightweight travel backpack." Subsequently, sellers can precisely deliver ads for this keyword, improving ad return on investment.

3. **In competitor ASIN management, DeepBI designs priority-based bidding rules.** When sellers add competitor ASINs, the system determines benchmark bids in priority order: first, if the competitor ASIN already has existing ad campaigns, prioritize using that ASIN campaign's average CPC as bid basis; second, if no existing campaigns, use the average CPC of all seller store ASINs in that ASIN's country or market; if the store's ASIN country CPC is unavailable, fall back to using the average CPC of all seller global store ASINs, finally using default CPC. This priority strategy ensures the system can fully utilize existing data for dynamic precise pricing and reasonable delivery cost control.

Based on the above, in DeepBI's intelligent system design, ASIN ads are equally important as keyword ads. When listing quality scores are not high, ASIN ads are even more important than keyword ads because ASIN ads can promote keyword ads. This is an important feature of DeepBI - ASINs can feedback to keywords. Therefore, DeepBI is complementary to competitors, manual operations, and original plans, not competitive.

## DeepBI's Beginner Strategy: Exploration Layer Discovery of Converting Keywords and Subsequent Feedback

In Amazon advertising operations, DeepBI adopts a unique and intelligent four-layer funnel strategy, discovering potential converting keywords through the exploration layer and using the system's reverse optimization mechanism to improve ad precision and effectiveness. This strategy is particularly suitable for new sellers because it reduces manual keyword selection workload through intelligent traffic screening, helping sellers gain precise and efficient traffic in complex advertising environments.

### 1. Core Role of Exploration Layer

In DeepBI's ad delivery, the exploration layer is the starting point of the entire strategy. Its core task is to screen potential high-value traffic from low-competition markets. In new sellers' early ad delivery, precise traffic acquisition and cost control are particularly important. The exploration layer's role is to help sellers acquire users interested in target products through precise ASIN ads.

**Operation Method:**

- In the exploration layer, DeepBI conducts precise penetration through ASIN ad delivery from competitor detail pages and keyword search results pages, quickly capturing potential customers.
- At this time, the system uses multiple matching methods (such as exact match, phrase match, broad match) for traffic incubation and screening, while conducting precise delivery through ASIN precise positioning and extended positioning.
- This method not only helps sellers quickly acquire traffic but also identifies which traffic has conversion potential and which keyword and ad delivery combinations are effective in a short time.

**Advantages for New Sellers:**

- **Reduce Keyword Selection Difficulty**: New sellers often lack sufficient market data and delivery experience, easily limited by personal understanding when choosing keywords. Through DeepBI's exploration layer, sellers can rely on system automated analysis to discover high-potential traffic.
- **Precise Delivery, Save Budget**: Through precise competitor ASIN ad delivery, sellers can quickly attract competitor traffic, avoiding budget waste from blind delivery.

### 2. Reverse Optimization and Keyword Feedback Mechanism

After the exploration layer screens potential keywords and traffic, DeepBI automatically feeds these valuable traffic back to subsequent ad delivery layers, forming an optimized cycle process. This process is called "reverse optimization" or "keyword feedback," which can continuously adjust ad target traffic and strategies through system learning and data feedback.

**Operation Method:**

- After successfully screening potential keywords in the exploration layer, these keywords are reverse-fed into subsequent precision layers, further screening high-conversion keywords and gradually expanding precise traffic pools.
- These keywords and ASINs are reclassified and invested in more precise ad delivery. The system automatically adjusts bids and delivery positions based on actual ad performance, further optimizing ad effectiveness.
- In the precision layer, DeepBI ensures high-quality traffic, avoiding ineffective traffic entry and improving ad budget usage efficiency.

**Advantages for New Sellers:**

- **Reduce Ad Adjustment Workload**: New sellers may not have sufficient ad analysis and adjustment capabilities, while DeepBI's reverse optimization mechanism can automatically analyze and adjust ad delivery, greatly reducing manual operation burden.
- **Improve Delivery Precision**: Through the feedback mechanism, DeepBI ensures screening of keywords that can bring actual conversions from low-competition traffic pools, avoiding mismatched traffic waste and improving ad return on investment (ROI).

### 3. In-depth Analysis: How to Discover Converting Keywords Through Exploration Layer

New sellers in Amazon ad delivery often face a challenge: how to quickly identify keywords that can bring conversions in the early stages. Traditional manual ad delivery often relies on personal experience, potentially leading to imprecise keyword delivery or poor effectiveness. DeepBI's exploration layer helps sellers find high-potential converting keywords in the initial stages through precise traffic screening.

**Key to Keyword Mining:**

- **Automated Analysis**: DeepBI automatically analyzes potential keywords through system automation, identifying words and ad combinations with high conversion potential without requiring excessive manual selection from sellers. This method greatly reduces new sellers' time costs and decision error rates in keyword selection.
- **Matching Optimization**: Through precise matching and extended matching, DeepBI can flexibly match market demand and keywords, discovering high-potential keywords that can bring conversions. For example, through competitor traffic data, DeepBI can find keywords highly relevant to sellers' products and apply them to ad delivery.
- **Real-time Data Feedback**: DeepBI adjusts keyword delivery in real-time based on actual ad performance, ensuring sellers can identify which keywords can bring actual orders in the shortest time, avoiding inefficient consumption from blind delivery.

### 4. Role of Four-Layer Funnel Mechanism

In DeepBI's ad strategy, the exploration layer is just the first step in the four-layer funnel mechanism. Each layer gradually screens quality traffic based on ad data feedback and ultimately optimizes to precise delivery strategies. This funnel mechanism ensures smooth transition from traffic to conversion and enables sellers to gain efficient ad effectiveness at low costs.

**Specifically, how the funnel mechanism works:**

- **Exploration Layer**: Mainly through ASIN ads and automatic ads exploring penetration into low-competition markets, the system automatically screens potential keywords and traffic seeds, providing data support for subsequent precise ad delivery.
- **Initial Screening Layer**: Based on real-time ad data, DeepBI screens well-performing keywords and ASINs and begins optimizing traffic sources.
- **Precision Layer**: Conducts precise ad delivery for already screened high-conversion keywords and ASINs, improving ad effectiveness stability and long-tail effects.
- **Volume Expansion Layer**: Based on the first three layers, DeepBI selects the best-performing keywords and ASINs for large-scale ad delivery, maximizing traffic and conversion.
