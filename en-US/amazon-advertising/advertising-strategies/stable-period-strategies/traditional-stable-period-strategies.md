# Traditional Amazon Advertising Strategies for Stable Period

During the stable period, Amazon sellers have achieved stable sales revenue, accumulated a certain customer base and ad delivery experience. The main goal of advertising shifts to how to further improve profits and optimize ad effectiveness based on existing foundations. At this time, the focus of ad operations is not only maintaining stable traffic and conversion rates but also how to efficiently use ad budgets, reduce unnecessary ad expenses, while further improving sales and customer lifetime value.

## Key Focus Areas for Amazon Advertising Operations in Stable Period

For Amazon sellers entering the stable period, the most important task is to ensure continuous high profits and avoid excessive competition or excessive ad budget consumption. At this time, the purpose of advertising is not only to attract new traffic but also to increase maintenance and remarketing of existing customers. Therefore, stable period ad strategies focus more on optimizing ad investment and sales processes through fine management to achieve higher return on investment (ROI).

Therefore, stable period sellers no longer rely on large amounts of traffic like in the early stages but focus more on how to extract maximum profits from known traffic. For example, conducting precise delivery for the most promising products, or adjusting bidding strategies based on ads that already have certain conversion rates to improve ad effectiveness. In the stable period, sellers' main focus shifts to how to further improve profits and optimize ad effectiveness based on existing foundations. This mainly involves the following aspects:

1. **How to Improve Conversion Rates**: In the stable period, sellers already have certain product sales and ad data. The next focus is improving conversion rates. By optimizing ad delivery and further improving product page attractiveness, conversion rates can be effectively improved. Sellers can improve conversion rates by optimizing ad keyword selection, adjusting ad bids, and optimizing product listings.
2. **How to Control Ad Costs and Improve ROI**: Based on sufficient traffic acquisition, sellers need to focus on how to achieve maximum ROI within limited ad budgets. Through fine management of ad bids and budget allocation adjustments, sellers can reduce ad costs and improve ad effectiveness.
3. **Optimize Repeat Purchase Rates of Existing Customers**: In the stable period, sellers should not only focus on acquiring new customers but also pay attention to repeat purchase rates of existing customers. Through precise remarketing ads and targeted delivery, sellers can effectively promote repeat purchases and improve customer lifetime value.
4. **Discover Potential Markets Through Ad Testing**: Stable period sellers can use ad testing to explore potential markets. Through A/B testing and other methods, sellers can discover which keywords and ad strategies can best improve sales, providing data support for subsequent ad delivery.

## Mainstream Ad Strategies for Stable Period Sellers

### 1. Fine Management of Manual Ads

In the stable period, sellers often use manual ads for precise control of ad effectiveness. Manual ads allow sellers to independently choose keywords, adjust bids, set ad display positions, etc., providing great flexibility and control.

**Operation Method:**

Stable period sellers use accumulated ad data to fine-manage manual ads. They usually set up multiple ad groups, each including different keywords, and optimize them based on performance. For example, by setting exact match, phrase match, and broad match keywords, keywords can be divided into different ad groups, and bids can be fine-tuned through continuous ad performance monitoring.

**Advantages:**

- **Precise Control**: Sellers can adjust each keyword based on ad data performance to optimize ad delivery effectiveness. Increase budgets for efficient keywords and timely adjust bids for inefficient keywords to avoid budget waste. For example, when a certain keyword's click-through and conversion rates perform excellently, sellers can choose to increase delivery budget to further drive sales.
- **Large Optimization Space**: Over time, sellers continuously collect ad data and conduct in-depth analysis of each keyword's performance. This data-driven approach helps sellers identify which keywords are most valuable, optimize ad budget usage, and improve ad effectiveness.
- **Cost Savings**: Manual ads enable sellers to make precise adjustments on keywords and bids, avoiding unnecessary budget waste. For example, sellers can reduce bids for keywords with low conversion rates but still getting many clicks, effectively concentrating ad budgets on the most promising keywords.

**Disadvantages:**

- **High Data Requirements**: Manual ads rely on large amounts of ad data to help sellers make accurate optimization decisions. Without sufficient historical data, sellers may have difficulty making reasonable adjustments. Especially for new sellers, manual ad effectiveness may be limited when lacking data support in the early stages.
- **High Time Cost**: Manual ads require frequent analysis of ad data, bid adjustments, and keyword optimization, which places high time demands on sellers. In the stable period, sellers may need to spend time daily reviewing ad data and making adjustments. Therefore, manual ad management requires more energy and time investment.

### 2. Continue Optimizing Automatic Ads

Although manual ads provide precise control, automatic ads also play an important role in the stable period. Automatic ads use Amazon's system to automatically match relevant keywords and display positions based on product information, helping sellers quickly expand traffic and automatically adjust ad strategies.

**Operation Method:**

In the stable period, sellers still use automatic ads as one traffic source. Unlike manual ads, automatic ads don't require sellers to choose keywords or set delivery strategies themselves. The system automatically matches and selects display positions based on keywords from product detail pages. Through automatic ads, sellers can continue expanding potential customer groups and further optimize delivery strategies based on performance data.

**Advantages:**

- **Easy Launch**: Automatic ads don't require sellers to invest much time and energy in keyword selection. The system automatically matches keywords based on product page content and market demand, displaying ads to potential buyers. For new sellers, automatic ads can be easily launched and gain traffic, helping them quickly enter the market.
- **Automatic Optimization**: Automatic ads can automatically adjust display strategies based on ad effectiveness (such as click-through and conversion rates), reducing seller management burden. The system automatically optimizes keyword delivery without requiring frequent seller adjustments, making the ad delivery process easier and more efficient.
- **Adapt to Market Changes**: Automatic ads can automatically adjust based on market changes. For example, during certain seasonal high-demand periods, the system can automatically optimize display strategies based on user search behavior and purchase trends, making ads better match target customer needs.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Weak Control**: Although automatic ads can provide certain optimization capabilities, compared to manual ads, sellers have limited control over keyword selection, display positions, bids, etc. Some poorly performing keywords may consume too much budget, and sellers cannot manually adjust these settings.
- **Uneven Budget Allocation**: Since automatic ads allocate budgets through system algorithms, sometimes certain poorly performing keywords may occupy too much budget, affecting overall ad effectiveness. The system may allocate budgets to keywords with high click volume but low conversion rates, thus wasting budget.

### 3. Use Sponsored Brands (SB) to Improve Brand Awareness

Sponsored Brands (SB) is an important advertising tool Amazon provides for sellers, especially suitable for sellers who have established a certain customer base and hope to further improve brand awareness. In the stable period, sellers can increase brand exposure through brand ads and enhance brand image.

**Operation Method:**

In the stable period, sellers can allocate part of their budget to brand ads, choosing brand-related keywords for precise delivery. Brand ads can display brand names, logos, and brand-related products, helping customers form brand recognition. Sellers can also use brand ads to guide potential customers to visit their brand flagship stores, improving brand loyalty.

**Advantages:**

- **Increase Exposure**: Brand ads help sellers improve brand exposure, especially in highly competitive markets, allowing sellers' brands to occupy a place in search results pages. By improving exposure, sellers can attract more potential customers and increase product sales opportunities.
- **Improve Brand Recognition**: Brand ads help customers build brand recognition through continuous display. For sellers, this is a key step in long-term brand building. Through repeated brand ad displays, customers gradually develop trust in the brand, improving customer purchase intent.
- **Attract Precise Traffic**: Brand ads can help sellers precisely target customer groups, attracting customers interested in the brand and products by displaying related products and brand information, improving ad conversion rates.

**Disadvantages:**

- **High Cost**: Brand ad delivery costs are usually high, especially in highly competitive markets, requiring large budget investments to gain sufficient exposure and clicks. For sellers with limited budgets, this may bring certain financial pressure.
- **Slow Effect**: Brand ad effects usually take a long time to show, especially in the early stages when brand awareness is low. Sellers may need to continuously deliver brand ads to build brand recognition. Therefore, brand ads have long effect times, and sellers need patience.
