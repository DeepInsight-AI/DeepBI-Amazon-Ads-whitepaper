# DeepBI's Stable Period Strategy VS Traditional Stable Period Strategy

In the stable period, traditional ad delivery strategies usually rely on sellers' subjective market judgment and accumulated historical data. Compared to DeepBI's intelligent and systematic strategies, traditional approaches have some shortcomings, while DeepBI effectively solves these problems through innovative four-layer traffic screening and dynamic budget optimization mechanisms.

## Challenges and Shortcomings of Traditional Ad Strategies

- **Single Keyword Selection and Intense Competition**: In traditional keyword delivery strategies, sellers usually choose some core keywords for ad delivery, especially in the stable period. Although these core keywords bring large traffic, they often come with huge competitive pressure. For budget-limited new sellers, forcibly competing for these keyword traffic often faces inefficient consumption and may even lead to rapid ad budget depletion without achieving expected conversion rates.
- **Inefficient Management of Long-tail Keywords**: Due to long-tail keywords' high conversion potential but large quantity and difficulty in manual screening, many sellers in the stable period easily overlook long-tail keyword potential. Even when trying to use long-tail keywords for ad delivery, due to high management difficulty, they often miss high-potential long-tail keywords or have incomplete delivery coverage, causing traffic gaps.
- **Lack of Precise Data Support**: Traditional ad delivery models often rely on historical data to judge keyword effectiveness, meaning sellers must go through multiple trial and error processes to gradually optimize ad effectiveness. Especially in highly competitive markets, relying on historical data to screen keywords and set budgets has significant errors.

## Unique Advantages of DeepBI Ad Strategies

- **Data Feedback and Continuous Optimization**: DeepBI's core advantage lies in its "ASIN Ads â†’ Keyword Feedback" mechanism. Through ASIN ad delivery, sellers can collect real-time data on which keywords bring actual conversion orders, continuously optimizing keyword pools and improving ad effectiveness. This feedback mechanism ensures continuous ad optimization, avoiding long-term unstable effectiveness issues in traditional ad delivery.

## DeepBI vs Traditional Ad Strategy Comparison

In the stable period, sellers' goals are no longer simple traffic acquisition but optimizing ad return on investment, improving conversion rates, reducing ad costs, and further expanding market share. At this time, ad delivery must not only maintain stable profit growth but also quickly and precisely expand traffic, breaking traditional ad delivery bottlenecks. Based on this, DeepBI and traditional ad strategies show obvious differences in multiple aspects.

### Traffic Acquisition and Precision Comparison

**Traditional Ad Strategy:**

Traditional ad strategies mainly rely on manual ad delivery, with sellers choosing keywords and setting ads based on their understanding and experience. In the stable period, sellers usually focus on core keywords for delivery, but these keywords have extremely intense competition, with ad budgets easily consumed on a large scale. Especially in core keyword price wars, it's difficult to see obvious profit returns in the short term. For long-tail keyword mining, although conversion potential is high, due to large quantity and constant changes, traditional manual ads often have difficulty efficiently covering these potential keywords in the short term. Many sellers may overlook certain high-potential long-tail keywords, missing potential traffic.

**DeepBI Ad Strategy:**

DeepBI's core advantage lies in its **precise traffic screening mechanism**. Through multi-dimensional data analysis and traffic feedback mechanisms, the system can precisely capture low-competition, high-potential traffic. Through ASIN ads penetrating less competitive traffic pools, the system can precisely screen keywords and ASINs that can bring high conversion rates, while converting successful ASIN traffic into keyword pools through reverse optimization, further optimizing traffic precision.

**Comparison:**

- **Precision Improvement**: Compared to traditional keyword delivery, DeepBI can significantly improve traffic precision through intelligent screening and reverse optimization, avoiding waste of large amounts of ineffective traffic.
- **Low-cost Efficient Acquisition**: DeepBI can precisely intercept traffic and gain low-cost traffic through competitor ASIN ads, while traditional approaches often rely on high-cost core keywords, leading to rapid ad budget consumption.

### Ad Management and Optimization Efficiency Comparison

**Traditional Ad Strategy:**

Traditional ad strategies rely on sellers manually analyzing data, adjusting keywords and budgets, etc. Especially in the stable period, sellers need to frequently check ad data, analyze which keywords are effective, and which ads perform poorly. This process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. For sellers with less experience, it's easy to get stuck in tedious operations. Especially when keyword quantity is large, manual screening and optimization workload is very high, leading to long optimization cycles and low efficiency.

**DeepBI Ad Strategy:**

DeepBI greatly reduces seller workload through automated data feedback and optimization mechanisms. DeepBI can automatically track ad performance, adjust bids, budgets, and delivery strategies in real-time, and optimize ad effectiveness through data feedback. Sellers don't need to frequently adjust keywords; the system automatically optimizes ads based on real-time data, helping sellers quickly discover high-conversion potential traffic in the stable period.

**Comparison:**

- **Efficient Optimization**: DeepBI's automated optimization greatly reduces sellers' time costs and energy consumption, especially suitable for sellers without much ad operation experience. In contrast, traditional ad strategy's manual optimization requires sellers to have high ad operation knowledge and invest significant time in data analysis and adjustments.
- **Automatic Data Feedback**: DeepBI's reverse optimization mechanism can automatically adjust keyword delivery based on ad effectiveness, while traditional approaches require sellers to manually analyze and make adjustments, with certain lag.

### Traffic Volume Expansion and Budget Management Comparison

**Traditional Ad Strategy:**

In the stable period, traditional ad strategies often rely on core keywords for volume expansion. Although this strategy can quickly increase exposure, it also faces high cost and inefficient consumption problems. Especially in categories with intense keyword competition, sellers easily fall into price wars, with low ad cost-effectiveness and difficulty maintaining high conversion rates. Due to limited budgets, new sellers are often very cautious when choosing core keywords, choosing too conservatively, leading to limited ad delivery effectiveness.

**DeepBI Ad Strategy:**

DeepBI ensures traffic precision and quality through four-layer funnel mechanisms and intelligent volume expansion strategies. In the early stages, DeepBI accumulates high-conversion keyword pools through precise screening and reverse optimization, then gradually expands volume and high-budget delivery in later stages, helping sellers expand market share. DeepBI not only efficiently guides traffic to product pages but also dynamically adjusts ad budgets during delivery, avoiding budget waste.

**Comparison:**

- **Intelligent Volume Expansion**: DeepBI's volume expansion strategy not only precisely screens potential traffic but also dynamically adjusts budgets through data feedback, ensuring maximum ad return on investment. In contrast, traditional ad strategy's volume expansion process is more conservative, easily falling into budget waste dilemmas when traffic is low.
- **Budget Allocation Optimization**: DeepBI can intelligently adjust budget allocation, avoiding certain poorly performing keywords occupying too much budget, while traditional approaches require sellers to manually control budget allocation, easily causing uneven allocation problems.

### Core Keyword Competition and Long-tail Keyword Mining Comparison

**Traditional Ad Strategy:**

In traditional keyword ads, core keyword competition is extremely intense, with high ad costs. Sellers often need to invest large budgets to occupy a place in search results. Although long-tail keywords have high conversion rates, due to large quantity and high mining difficulty, traditional ad strategies often rely on sellers manually selecting and optimizing keywords, which is not only inefficient but also easily misses certain high-potential long-tail keywords.

**DeepBI Ad Strategy:**

DeepBI can precisely mine high-conversion potential long-tail keywords through competitor ASIN traffic interception, while continuously providing data support for later keyword ads through ASIN ads. DeepBI's system can help sellers quickly penetrate long-tail markets and maximize conversion potential through multi-dimensional traffic screening and automated reverse optimization.

**Comparison:**

- **Long-tail Keyword Mining**: DeepBI can efficiently mine and utilize long-tail keywords through automated traffic screening and reverse optimization, solving traditional approaches' mining difficulties, especially suitable for budget-limited sellers.
- **Core Keyword Competition**: DeepBI avoids traditional ads' head keyword price war dilemmas through precise competitor traffic interception and low-competition traffic precise delivery, enabling sellers to gain efficient traffic at lower costs.
