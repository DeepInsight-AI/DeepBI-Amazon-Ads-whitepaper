# DeepBI's Stable Period Strategy: Volume Expansion and Precise Traffic Aggregation

As described in Section 3 of 2.4.2, in the stable period of Amazon advertising operations, DeepBI's strategy differs from early traffic acquisition strategies, mainly focusing on expanding efficient traffic pools, improving conversion rates, and optimizing ad return on investment (ROI). DeepBI's stable period ad strategy focuses on continuously amplifying ad effectiveness through precise traffic management and system optimization, ultimately achieving efficient ad investment.

## Volume Expansion and Precise Traffic Aggregation

**Core Strategy:**

In the stable period, DeepBI's core strategy is to mine "dark horse keywords" from high-conversion keywords and competitor ASIN traffic accumulated in the early stages - traffic seeds with potential but not yet scaled up. Through systematic multi-layer screening and optimization, DeepBI will precisely amplify these traffic seeds and conduct high-budget delivery, thereby driving large-scale ad traffic increases and improving overall ad return on investment.

**Volume Expansion Layer Operation Method:**

- **Focus on Quality Traffic**: In DeepBI's traffic screening mechanism, the volume expansion layer aims to ensure that high-conversion keywords and ASINs that have passed the first three layers (exploration, initial screening, precision) get sufficient exposure and volume expansion. Traffic seeds at this stage have undergone multiple rounds of verification, with high click-through rates (CTR), high conversion rates (CVR), low advertising cost of sales (ACoS), and stable return on investment (ROI).
- **Dynamic Budget Allocation**: DeepBI's AI system automatically adjusts budget allocation based on each keyword and ASIN's historical performance and real-time data, ensuring optimal traffic gets maximum exposure. Through efficient budget allocation, DeepBI helps sellers concentrate resources on traffic that can truly bring high returns, avoiding unnecessary budget waste.
- **Effective Volume Expansion of High-Competition Traffic**: In the stable period, sellers usually have achieved certain market share, so the core of delivery strategy is maximizing exposure in high-competition markets. DeepBI helps sellers break through competition barriers of core keywords through precise bidding strategies, using the volume expansion layer to quickly amplify traffic, maintaining market competitiveness.

**Advantages:**

- **Precise Screening and Efficient Volume Expansion**: The volume expansion layer strategy ensures only traffic that has undergone multiple rounds of verification with high conversion rates and low costs will be amplified. This precise traffic management enables sellers to avoid large-scale inefficient traffic consumption and maximize ad budget effectiveness.
- **Reduce Trial and Error Costs**: In the stable period, through volume expansion seed screening, sellers can effectively reduce time costs and capital waste of trying unsuitable traffic. DeepBI continuously adjusts and optimizes traffic pool quality through constant adjustment and optimization, ensuring ads can continuously bring efficient traffic during growth periods.

## High-Budget Delivery and Multi-Channel Exposure

In the stable period, sellers' ad budgets are usually relatively sufficient, so DeepBI helps sellers enter large-scale delivery stages. This stage's ad delivery is not limited to single ASIN ads or keyword ads but combines different ad positions, ad types, and delivery strategies to ensure brands and products get broader market exposure.

**High-Budget Delivery Strategy:**

- **Multi-Ad Position Precise Delivery**: DeepBI supports simultaneous ad delivery in multiple ad positions (such as competitor pages, search results pages, keyword matching ads, etc.). By displaying ads in different positions, sellers can gain more traffic sources, breaking single-channel dependency limitations.
- **Expand to Segmented Markets**: In the stable period, sellers can further penetrate segmented markets through DeepBI's precise delivery. Through deep mining of high-potential keywords, sellers can discover traffic pools that haven't been fully utilized, expanding to previously untapped customer groups.
- **Continuous Competitor Traffic Capture**: DeepBI relies on competitor ASIN ads to help sellers intercept competitor traffic through precise matching ad delivery and convert it into their own customers. This traffic capture not only improves conversion rates but also gains more exposure and orders in highly competitive markets.

**Advantages:**

- **Precise Delivery Reduces Budget Waste**: Through multi-ad position precise delivery and high-budget allocation, DeepBI ensures sellers don't waste any budget during stable period ad delivery. Every budget will be maximally utilized to drive sales growth.
- **Expand Market Share**: High-budget delivery enables sellers to quickly expand market share in the stable period, especially when market competition is intense. DeepBI helps sellers break through price barriers and gain more potential customer attention.

## Stable Period Profit Growth: Optimize Conversion and Control Risk

In the stable period, sellers' ad delivery main goals are not only to increase traffic but also to ensure traffic can convert into actual orders, further achieving profit growth. DeepBI's strategy helps sellers achieve profit maximization through precise traffic and effective budget management.

**How to Achieve Profit Growth:**

- **Improve Conversion Rates Through Precise Keywords and Competitor Ads**: DeepBI helps sellers gradually optimize high-conversion keywords in the stable period, maximizing delivery effectiveness of these keywords. Through precise traffic delivery, sellers can improve conversion rates based on already acquired traffic, further increasing order quantity and profits.
- **Risk Control and Cost Monitoring**: DeepBI effectively controls ad investment risks through AI-driven bid adjustments and dynamic budget allocation. In the stable period, sellers can avoid capital waste caused by blind volume expansion or excessive budget consumption. DeepBI's real-time monitoring and adjustment capabilities enable sellers to effectively avoid unreasonable ad budget allocation while ensuring profits.

**Advantages:**

- **Improve Conversion Rates and ROI**: Through precise keyword and competitor ad delivery, DeepBI ensures sellers' ad traffic can bring higher conversion rates. Through precise delivery and data feedback, DeepBI helps sellers optimize ad effectiveness, achieving higher ROI.
- **Reduce Risk, Ensure Profits**: Through AI and intelligent budget management, DeepBI can help sellers achieve maximum ad effectiveness in the stable period while avoiding profit decline caused by excessive delivery or budget waste.
