# Solution for High Conversion Rate but Budget Exhausted

## High Conversion Rate but Budget Exhausted: Solution

In Amazon advertising operations, the most frustrating situation is when an ad group has extremely high conversion rates but is forced to stop delivery due to budget exhaustion. Behind this phenomenon often hide two core contradictions: first, budget allocation fails to precisely match ad performance, causing quality traffic loss due to funding shortages; second, manual adjustment lag struggles to handle real-time changing ad competitive environments.

### Traditional Operations' Dilemmas and Remedies

In traditional advertising operations, conventional solutions to this problem involve manual budget allocation adjustment. For example, cutting budgets for mediocre-performing ad groups and concentrating resources on high-conversion ads; or directly increasing overall budgets to ensure quality ads continue exposure. However, this method has obvious flaws: manual analysis relies on experience-based judgment, struggling to simultaneously consider real-time data from dozens of ad groups; budget adjustments are often based on single-day performance, lacking comprehensive consideration of long-term trends; more critically, manual operations cannot achieve minute-level dynamic response, easily missing delivery opportunities during traffic peaks.

### DeepBI's Intelligent Budget Logic

DeepBI's budget strategy system fundamentally changes this passive situation. Its core lies in establishing an automated mechanism of "condition triggering + dynamic control." The system simultaneously monitors ad groups' short-term (yesterday) and recent days' ACOS performance. When high-conversion ad groups simultaneously meet spending exceeding set budget thresholds (insufficient budget) and profitability indicators (but profitable), it automatically increases budgets by preset amounts, ensuring quality traffic isn't interrupted; conversely, for long-term poorly performing ad groups, it implements budget contraction, directing resources to more efficient delivery positions.

This dynamic balance isn't uncontrolled adjustment. DeepBI sets budget upper and lower limits for each ad group, avoiding waste from excessive budgets while preventing low budgets from affecting ad weight. More commendable is that the system proactively checks inventory status before increasing budgets, preventing "explosive orders causing stockouts" risks from the source.

### Dimensional Reduction Comparison Between Machine and Manual

Compared to traditional methods, DeepBI's advantages are reflected in four dimensions: in response speed, machines can complete adjustments the moment budgets reach thresholds, while manual operations have at least several hours delay; in decision dimensions, systems can simultaneously analyze spending ratios, ACOS trends, inventory depth, and multiple factors, far exceeding human capacity for handling complex data; in risk control, preset ceiling mechanisms and inventory linkage functions are far more precise and reliable than manual estimation; in processing scale, machines can simultaneously monitor massive data in real-time and make immediate responses, while manual operations require costs proportional to scale and still "favor one over others."

A client once gave us a typical case: before using DeepBI, his home category ad group maintained stable 15% conversion rates long-term, but budgets were exhausted daily after 3 PM. The manual team tried multiple segmented budget increases, all causing ACOS surges due to inability to precisely predict traffic fluctuations. After integrating DeepBI, the system automatically identified this time period as golden conversion hours, dynamically adding 23%-28% budget daily while maintaining qualified ACOS, ultimately increasing the ad group's weekly average sales by 47% without budget overruns.

The essence of this "intelligent control" transforms advertising budgets from fixed costs into elastic resources. Just like irrigating farmland, traditional methods are flood irrigation, while DeepBI installs drip irrigation systems - every budget penny is precisely delivered to the "crop" roots most thirsty for traffic. For sellers eager to break through growth bottlenecks, this may be a required course in the digital marketing era.
