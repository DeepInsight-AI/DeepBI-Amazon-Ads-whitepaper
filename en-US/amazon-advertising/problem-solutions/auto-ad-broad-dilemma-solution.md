# Auto Ad Broad Dilemma and Intelligent Solution

In Amazon advertising operations, auto ads are often compared to "casting nets to catch fish" - they can quickly cover massive traffic, but when mesh holes are too large, they inevitably catch many useless impurities. Many sellers find that while auto ads bring considerable click volume, conversion rates remain persistently low, even causing advertising costs to surge due to ineffective clicks. The core contradiction behind this lies in: the system's default broad match logic lacks precise screening capabilities, while traditional manual optimization methods are inefficient.

## Refined Transformation of Traditional Methods

Facing auto ads' broad problems, experienced sellers' first reaction is often switching to manual ads. By manually screening high-conversion keywords, setting precise match types, and continuously monitoring ad reports, gradually adding ineffective keywords to negative lists. This process requires extreme patience and data sensitivity: for example, when discovering a keyword with high clicks but zero conversion rate, it needs immediate negation; if a long-tail keyword performs excellently, bids need increasing and expanding to phrase match to test potential. However, this "manual + experience" model has obvious bottlenecks: time-consuming and labor-intensive, difficult for small and medium sellers to sustain; reliance on personal judgment, easily missing hidden dark horse keywords or misjudging traffic value.

## DeepBI's Intelligent Four-Layer Funnel Strategy

DeepBI's solution fundamentally disrupts traditional "one-size-fits-all" ad models, with its core being building a dynamic circular four-layer traffic screening mechanism. In the exploration layer, the system combines auto ads and ASIN ads for attack, but not blindly spreading volume - auto ads only serve as small-scale "scout" roles, while ASIN ads' main task is quickly capturing potential user behavioral data through competitor detail pages and keyword search page ASIN ad positions. For example, when users frequently browse competitor pages and generate orders, DeepBI will prioritize displaying more cost-effective similar products in their bottom ad positions, directly intercepting traffic through comparative advantages.

After entering the initial screening layer, AI begins first cleaning of exploration layer data. Those accidentally converting inefficient traffic are automatically filtered, while keywords and ASINs showing conversion potential enter the next round of testing.

In the precision and scaling layers, DeepBI's strategic advantages become more prominent. High-quality traffic verified through the first two rounds is concentrated for delivery, with auto ads' proportion now minimal, and main forces becoming manual precise matching and ASIN precise targeting. This "broad first, narrow later" progressive architecture avoids auto ad fluctuations interfering with overall plans while ensuring budgets concentrate on the highest quality traffic pools.

## Efficiency Comparison Between Intelligent and Manual Methods

Traditional methods are like an experienced fisherman who needs repeated trial and error to find the best fishing spots; DeepBI is like a modern fishing boat equipped with sonar systems, able to scan fish school positions in real-time and adjust mesh sizes. Specifically, AI systems achieve breakthroughs in three aspects: efficiency-wise, keyword screening that traditional methods need weeks to complete, DeepBI can explore and lock targets within days through real-time data attribution; precision-wise, manual operations are easily influenced by subjective preferences, while AI makes decisions entirely based on objective indicators like conversion rates and ACOS; sustainability-wise, DeepBI's "ASIN ads feeding back keywords" mechanism forms closed-loop optimization, while manual operations often fall into fatigue cycles of "find keywords-negate-find keywords again."

For resource-limited small and medium sellers, this intelligent strategy is more universal. It neither requires building professional operations teams nor demands sellers possess complex data analysis capabilities. A home goods seller on Amazon, after adopting DeepBI, saw their ad ACOS drop from 45% to 22% within three months, while competitors relying on manual optimization remained above 35%. This gap doesn't stem from operator skill levels but essential differences in tool methodology - while others are still using magnifying glasses to find keywords, intelligent systems have already scanned the entire battlefield.
