# Ad Delivery Performs Well but Competitors Increase Delivery, Causing Sales Drop

## How to Respond When Competitors Increase Delivery

When ad delivery performs well but suddenly encounters competitors increasing advertising budgets, causing sales decline, this is a problem many Amazon sellers face. On the surface, it seems competitors have captured market share, but underlying causes are often more complex.

### Core Issues of Intensified Competition

Competitors increasing ad delivery intensity most directly affects ad position competition becoming more intense. Originally well-performing keywords may have exposure squeezed due to competitors raising bids, causing click costs to rise. Even if ad click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates (CVR) remain high, overall ad return on investment (ROI) may decline due to intensified competition. Additionally, some competitors may adopt aggressive price war strategies, further compressing profit margins.

In such situations, traditional Amazon advertising operation methods typically have two response approaches: first, increase bids to ensure ad rankings aren't suppressed; second, optimize ad precision, reduce ineffective exposure, improve conversion efficiency. However, both approaches have limitations. Simply increasing bids may cause ad costs to spiral out of control, while over-optimizing precision may sacrifice potential exposure opportunities.

### Limitations of Traditional Advertising Operations

Traditional methods rely on manual adjustment, struggling to respond to market changes in real-time. For example, when competitors suddenly increase certain keyword bids, manual bid adjustments often lag, causing ad positions to be captured. Additionally, manual optimization struggles to simultaneously consider multiple data dimensions like ACOS (advertising cost of sales), click volume, conversion rates, etc., easily favoring one over others.

More critically, traditional methods lack intelligent dynamic balance mechanisms. If blindly increasing bids, they may fall into vicious competition, ultimately causing ad costs to surge and profits to shrink significantly. If relying solely on manual experience adjustment, they struggle to precisely identify which keywords deserve price increases and which should be optimized through price reduction.

### DeepBI's Intelligent Response Strategy

DeepBI's advertising operation system can dynamically adjust advertising strategies through AI algorithms, ensuring profitability even when competition intensifies. Its core logic is the coordinated operation of "priority keyword strategy" and "ACOS control strategy," ensuring competitiveness while avoiding excessive budget consumption.

**Priority keyword strategy** mainly targets well-performing keywords, appropriately increasing bids when competition intensifies to ensure ad positions aren't captured. This strategy isn't blind price increases but intelligent adjustment based on historical data and current performance, avoiding ineffective competition. For example, the system screens keywords with high conversion rates and controllable ACOS, only increasing bids when necessary rather than treating all keywords equally.

**ACOS control strategy** plays a balancing role, preventing ad costs from spiraling out of control. When certain keywords or ASINs have poor recent ACOS trends, the system automatically reduces bids, decreasing inefficient spending. This strategy complements priority keyword strategy, ensuring advertising budgets always flow to high-return keywords rather than being wasted on inefficient competition.

Additionally, DeepBI's **automatic keyword addition strategy** can continuously mine new high-potential keywords, helping sellers escape original competitive frameworks and find new growth points. For example, the system can automatically identify seasonal trend keywords or long-tail keywords, providing more possibilities for ad delivery and avoiding over-dependence on few high-competition keywords.

### Comparison Between Traditional Methods and DeepBI

Traditional advertising operations rely on manual experience with slow adjustment speeds and struggle to precisely balance bidding and costs. DeepBI's AI-driven strategies can analyze market changes in real-time, dynamically adjust bids, ensuring ads always remain in optimal states.

For example, when competitors suddenly increase delivery, traditional methods may take hours or longer to respond, while DeepBI can complete data analysis and execute adjustments within minutes. Additionally, traditional methods easily fall into "one-size-fits-all" misconceptions, either comprehensively increasing or decreasing prices, while DeepBI can differentially adjust based on different keyword performance, ensuring every advertising budget penny is spent wisely.

### Conclusion

In Amazon's increasingly competitive advertising environment, relying solely on traditional operational methods can no longer maintain long-term advantages. DeepBI's intelligent advertising strategies help sellers maintain leadership in competition through dynamic adjustment, precise optimization, and continuous mining of new opportunities. Whether responding to competitors' sudden price increases or optimizing long-term advertising cost structures, DeepBI can provide more efficient and precise solutions.

For sellers hoping for continuous growth, embracing AI-driven advertising optimization tools may be the key to victory in the next stage.
