# Solution for Unstable Keyword Performance and Ad Effect Fluctuations

In Amazon advertising operations, unstable keyword performance is a common problem many sellers face. Ad effects fluctuate between highs and lows, sometimes bringing massive orders, sometimes falling silent. This volatility not only affects sales expectations but may also cause budget waste. The root cause is that keyword volatility often relates to market competition, seasonal changes, consumer demand fluctuations, and insufficient flexibility in ad delivery strategies.

## Limitations of Traditional Operational Methods

Traditional Amazon advertising operational methods mainly rely on manual monitoring and adjustment. Operators need to regularly analyze keyword performance data, screen keywords with high volatility, and optimize ad effects through manual bid adjustments or pausing poorly performing keywords. While this method is effective, it has obvious limitations. First, manual analysis struggles to cover massive keywords with slow response speeds, often missing optimal adjustment timing. Second, market changes are rapid, and manual methods alone struggle to accurately predict keyword trends, especially during peak seasons or promotional periods when competition is intense and keyword bids and performance may change hourly. Additionally, traditional methods lack systematic strategies to handle keyword cyclical volatility. For example, certain keywords perform well during specific time periods but poorly at other times, making continuous optimization through manual adjustment difficult.

## DeepBI's Intelligent Solution

Compared to traditional methods, DeepBI's advertising operation system can more efficiently handle keyword volatility issues through AI-driven automated strategies. The system dynamically adjusts ad bids based on real-time data monitoring and algorithm analysis, ensuring keywords operate at optimal states.

In exposure increase strategies, DeepBI adopts circular bid adjustment mechanisms. When keyword bids reach preset upper limits, the system automatically calls back to lower limit values, restarting bid adjustment cycles and re-exploring at low prices, with **continuous traffic seeds** joining through DeepBI system exploration. This mechanism effectively avoids cost control loss due to excessive price increases while adapting to product seasonal demand changes. For example, during peak seasons, the system actively increases bids to capture traffic; during off-seasons, it controls costs through callback mechanisms and continuous new traffic seed addition, ensuring ad delivery sustainability.

For unstable keyword performance issues, DeepBI combines exposure control and ACOS control strategies. Exposure control strategy dynamically reduces bids for keywords that haven't generated effective conversions, decreasing ineffective spending; while ACOS control strategy focuses on suppressing high-spending, low-return keywords, optimizing overall ad efficiency through unidirectional price reduction. These two strategies complement each other, avoiding budget waste while ensuring high-potential keywords receive sufficient exposure.

## Views on Time-Segmented High-Frequency Control

The problem of ads performing exceptionally well in certain time periods but then dropping sharply is a common challenge many Amazon advertisers face. Good performance in certain periods may be due to short-term demand increases, such as during specific shopping hours or user active periods when ads can gain more exposure and clicks. However, when these external conditions change or competitors also invest more ads during the same periods, ad performance drops rapidly, struggling to maintain previous exposure and click-through rates. This phenomenon often leads to highly unstable ad effects, preventing advertisers from gaining long-term sustainable returns from ad delivery. Therefore, some clients believe time-segmented high-frequency control is necessary.

We found that refining ad delivery to specific time periods for high-frequency control doesn't bring significant effects. First, due to market demand and competition changes, ad performance volatility is often unpredictable. Even relying on manual real-time adjustment may only increase operational workload without stabilizing ad effects. Second, this requires long-term data support and verification to effectively judge which time periods have significant traffic differences. Through over a year of DeepBI practice verification, we conducted data analysis and concluded that: pure optimization for specific time periods often has limited effects. While this method can give advertisers short-term traffic boosts in certain periods, through our repeated testing and verification, long-term results show that time-segmented high-frequency adjustment test groups' ACOS equaled or was slightly lower than normal ad campaigns, but sales were far below normal ad campaigns.

As for reasons, we also provided relevant conclusion analysis for readers' reference: Amazon's advertising platform actually has related algorithms for intelligent traffic pushing by time periods. Even after long-term data verification showing good delivery effects in certain time periods, it may fall into "favoring one over others" traps, reducing delivery returns in other time periods, and may be caught off guard by sudden drops due to rapid traffic changes throughout the day. Despite this, DeepBI still provides intelligent time-segmented budget management functions for ad sellers to use during delivery; meanwhile, the DeepBI team provides specialist support to offer suggestions and needed help for each client.

## Comparison Between Traditional Methods and DeepBI

Traditional operational methods rely on manual experience with slow adjustment speeds and struggle to handle complex, changing market environments. DeepBI's intelligent system can monitor keyword performance in real-time, quickly and scientifically respond based on data, ensuring ads remain in optimal states. Additionally, DeepBI's strategies are more systematic, not only considering short-term effects but also ensuring long-term delivery stability through mechanisms like circular bid adjustment.

For sellers, adopting DeepBI means higher ad efficiency and lower operational costs. The system's automation liberates manpower, allowing sellers to focus energy on product optimization and strategic planning rather than tedious ad adjustments. On the increasingly competitive Amazon platform, this intelligent operational approach undoubtedly has more advantages.

## Conclusion

Unstable keyword performance is a major challenge in Amazon advertising operations, but through reasonable strategies and tools, it can be completely transformed into a controllable factor. Traditional manual adjustment methods have some effect but lack efficiency and precision. In comparison, DeepBI's intelligent system, through data-driven automated strategies, not only quickly responds to market changes but also continuously optimizes ad effects, helping sellers gain competitive advantages. For sellers hoping to improve ad ROI, embracing intelligent tools may be the inevitable path forward.
