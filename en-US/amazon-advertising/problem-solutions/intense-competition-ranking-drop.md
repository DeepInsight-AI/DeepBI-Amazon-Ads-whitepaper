# Intense Competition Causing Ad Ranking Drop: What to Do?

## What Happens Behind Ad Ranking Decline?

In Amazon's advertising ecosystem, intensifying competition is often like a silent war. When numerous sellers flood the same category, especially competing for top keywords, ad position scarcity directly drives up CPC (cost per click). We've observed that many new products get caught in dilemmas during delivery exploration: if they persist in bidding major keywords, they may fail to sustain exposure due to budget depletion; if they turn to long-tail keywords, they struggle to quickly open traffic entry points. The root cause of this vicious cycle lies in traditional advertising operations' "linear thinking" - only maintaining rankings through increased bids or expanded budgets while ignoring the dynamic balance between traffic quality and cost efficiency.

The deeper issue is that ad ranking declines trigger chain reactions. Reduced exposure leads to click volume drops, affecting conversion rates and organic rankings, ultimately forming a closed loop of "less exposure means less sales, less sales means harder to gain exposure." At this point, relying solely on manual adjustments often struggles to capture competitive environment changes in real-time. For example, competitors may suddenly increase bids during specific time periods or capture related traffic through ASIN targeted ads. Traditional methods require operators to monitor data 24/7 and manually adjust prices, not only inefficient but also prone to budget waste due to human misjudgment.

## Traditional Methods' Breakthrough Strategies and Limitations

Facing ad ranking decline, traditional operators typically adopt two strategies: **"head-to-head" bidding** or **"off-peak competition"**. The former maintains ad positions through increased bids, but risks falling into "budget black holes" - especially when product conversion rates don't improve simultaneously, high CPC rapidly drives up ACOS (advertising cost of sales). We once tested a home product, increasing core keyword bids by 20%, and while rankings rose to the homepage, ACOS surged to 45%, far exceeding the break-even point.

The latter strategy is more cautious: choosing less competitive long-tail keywords or concentrating delivery during traffic low periods (like weekday mornings). While this method can reduce costs, it sacrifices exposure opportunities during core traffic windows. For example, an outdoor equipment seller only delivered ads at night, maintaining ACOS under 15% but with daily order volume only 1/3 of competitors. More critically, this "avoidance" strategy cannot accumulate keyword weight, weakening product traffic competitiveness long-term.

The essential problem with traditional methods lies in **"static response to dynamic competition"**. Manual adjustments cannot respond to market changes in real-time, while one-size-fits-all bidding strategies ignore individual keyword performance differences. For example, some keywords in the same ad group may have extremely low ACOS but get buried due to overall budget allocation imbalance.

## DeepBI's Intelligent Offense-Defense System: From "Exposure Control" to "Dark Horse Mining"

Compared to traditional methods, DeepBI's solution builds a dynamic offense-defense system. Its core lies in **"data-driven replacement of experience-driven"**, executing precise keyword-level strategy combinations through AI real-time analysis of competitive environments and ad performance.

When ad rankings decline due to competition, the system first launches **"exposure increase strategy"**, but not blindly increasing prices. For example, targeting manual ads (sp-manu) and ASIN targeted ads (sp-asin), the system prioritizes increasing exposure in ads with high conversion rates and good ACOS. Meanwhile, DeepBI synchronously monitors inventory depth and ACOS trends. If exposure surges but conversions lag, it immediately triggers **"exposure control strategy"**. For example, when a keyword's recent average ACOS exceeds thresholds, the system automatically lowers its bid to avoid inefficient traffic wasting budget. This "dynamic braking" mechanism solves traditional methods' pain point of "losing control once prices increase."

More breakthrough is the **"four-layer traffic mechanism"**. Traditional operations often focus on top keyword battles, while DeepBI mines overlooked traffic layers through AI:

1. **High-conversion long-tail keywords**: The system automatically identifies "dark horse keywords" with low CPC but stable conversions. For example, in a pet product ad, the originally unnoticed "durable puppy toys" keyword had only 8% ACOS but became a main traffic source through system recommendation;
2. **Competitor-related traffic**: Analyzing weak-related keywords of competitor ASINs to enter precise user scenarios at lower costs;
3. **Time-based blue oceans**: Locking competitive low periods based on historical data to achieve off-peak without reducing volume;
4. **Automatic negative defense**: Real-time blocking of inefficient traffic. For example, in a baby product ad, the system automatically added "adult suitable" search terms to negative lists, reducing 15% of ineffective spending.

## Ultimate Showdown: Efficiency Comparison Between Traditional Methods and DeepBI

A client conducted A/B testing comparing both methods with the same product when trialing DeepBI. In traditional mode, the operations team manually adjusted bids 3 times daily, focusing on the top 20 keywords, achieving 28% ACOS with 12% weekly order growth. The DeepBI group had zero manual intervention, with system adjustments reaching 47 times daily (covering all 312 keywords), ACOS dropped to 19% with 34% order growth.

The key difference lies in **"strategy synergy and granularity"**. Traditional methods are like a boxer, only relying on heavy punches (high prices) or dodging (avoiding peaks); while DeepBI is more like a special forces team, using sniper rifles (precise matching high-price keywords) to open breakthroughs, scouts (long-tail keyword mining) to expand results, and engineers (negative management) to clean the battlefield. This multi-threaded capability is precisely the core leap from Amazon advertising transitioning from "cost center" to "profit engine."
