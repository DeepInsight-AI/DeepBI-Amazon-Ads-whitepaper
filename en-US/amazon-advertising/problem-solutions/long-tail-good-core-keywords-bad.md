# Long-Tail Keywords Perform Well but Core Keywords Are Poor: What to Do?

In Amazon advertising operations, many sellers encounter a typical problem: long-tail keywords have stable conversions, but core major keywords consistently perform poorly. Behind this lies the underlying logic of traffic competition and precise targeting, and solving this problem requires combining traditional operational experience with intelligent tools' dual strategies.

## The Game Between Long-Tail and Major Keywords

Long-tail keywords typically consist of multiple words, such as "waterproof Bluetooth headphones sports version." These keywords have lower search volume but less competition and clear user intent, often with higher conversion rates. Core major keywords like "Bluetooth headphones" have massive traffic but intense competition, with ad positions monopolized by top sellers, leading to high cost per click (CPC) while conversion rates may be low due to broad user needs or specific product targeting. This difference creates a dilemma in advertising budget allocation: over-investing in major keywords may cause ACOS (advertising cost of sales) to spiral out of control, while relying solely on long-tail keywords struggles to break through traffic ceilings.

Traditional operational methods tend toward "play to strengths, avoid weaknesses" - tilting budgets toward well-performing long-tail keywords while optimizing core keywords. For example, using precise matching to limit major keywords' trigger scope, or mining long-tail variants related to major keywords (like "wireless sports Bluetooth headphones"). But this method relies on manual analysis, is inefficient, and struggles to dynamically respond to market changes.

## Strategic Upgrade from Manual to Intelligent

DeepBI's advertising strategy system transforms traditional experience into executable intelligent solutions through data-driven and automated technology. Taking long-tail keywords as an example, its "automatic keyword addition strategy" can continuously mine high-potential keywords: the system first captures historical converting search terms, then screens and verifies them, adding long-tail keywords with low ACOS and high conversion to ad groups, and expanding traffic through broad, phrase, and precise match types. For example, after a long-tail keyword "bone conduction headphones for running" converts, the system automatically includes it in delivery, and later through DeepBI's initial screening and precision layers, eliminates accidentally converting keywords, screening out low-cost, high-conversion dark horse traffic seeds.

For poorly performing core keywords, DeepBI adopts dual strategies of "ACOS control" and "exposure control." The former targets keywords that have generated spending but exceed ACOS thresholds, dynamically lowering bids to reduce inefficient consumption; the latter directly limits high-exposure, low-conversion keywords to avoid budget waste. Both strategies are based on average ACOS data from recent days, avoiding single-day fluctuation interference and ensuring comprehensive adjustment coverage.

## Core Advantages of Intelligent Tools

Compared to traditional methods, DeepBI's greatest value lies in "dynamic balance." Manual operations often lag behind data changes, while AI systems can monitor keyword performance in real-time. For example: when a long-tail keyword suddenly explodes due to market trends (like "holiday limited edition headphones"), the system will automatically increase bids to capture traffic through "priority keyword strategy"; conversely, if core keyword ACOS continues deteriorating, the system automatically executes price reduction. This "offensive and defensive" mechanism both protects long-tail keywords' conversion advantages and gradually optimizes core keyword efficiency.

More critically, DeepBI's strategies have synergistic effects. The automatic keyword addition strategy continuously expands high-conversion keyword libraries, while ACOS control and exposure control strategies eliminate inefficient keywords, forming a "self-purifying" advertising ecosystem that screens for more low-cost, high-conversion dark horse seeds. A DeepBI user once tested a new product, with initial core keyword ACOS as high as 50%. Through intelligent control and long-tail keyword expansion, overall ACOS dropped to 18% within two weeks, with order volume doubling.

## Summary

The contradiction between long-tail and core keywords essentially reflects the trade-off between traffic precision and scale. Traditional methods rely on static optimization, while DeepBI achieves dual goals of "precise traffic expansion" and "cost control" through dynamic strategy chains. For sellers, embracing intelligent tools isn't about replacing manual judgment but transforming experience into replicable system capabilities, ultimately building sustainable advertising advantages in Amazon's competitive red ocean.
