# Solution for Multiple Price Increases but ACOS Remaining High

When sellers repeatedly increase ad bids but ACOS (advertising cost of sales) shows no improvement, this often exposes two core problems: first, selected keywords lack conversion potential; second, ads fail to precisely reach target customer groups. Simply increasing bids can boost exposure and clicks, but if conversion rates don't improve simultaneously, it leads to persistently high ACOS values and budget waste.

## Limitations of Traditional Operations

In traditional Amazon advertising operations, common approaches to high ACOS include re-screening keywords or optimizing ad content. For example, pausing poorly performing keywords and tilting budgets toward ad positions with higher conversion rates. This method relies on manual experience, requiring frequent data monitoring and manual adjustment, with low efficiency and easy lag. More critically, when ad group overall conversion rates are low, local optimization alone struggles to reverse decline. If blindly increasing prices continues at this point, it only accelerates budget consumption, falling into the vicious cycle of "burning money for exposure."

## DeepBI's Intelligent Control Logic

Unlike traditional methods, DeepBI solves high ACOS problems from the root through AI-driven dynamic strategy combinations. Its core lies in data-driven real-time decision-making:

First, the system identifies keywords with low conversion rates, automatically reducing exposure weights of inefficient ads through historical performance analysis, avoiding budget waste from ineffective traffic. Meanwhile, implementing precise price increases for keywords with high conversion potential, ensuring every budget penny is spent wisely.

Second, DeepBI's "exposure control strategy" can intelligently balance ad display volume. When exposure exceeds reasonable ranges, the system automatically adjusts bids based on recent ACOS trends, preventing over-delivery due to short-term fluctuations. For example, if an ad's recent ACOS continuously exceeds standards, even with surging exposure, the system prioritizes price reduction over blind pursuit.

Finally, budget allocation is completely dynamically optimized by algorithms. Well-performing ad groups automatically receive budget tilting, while long-term inefficient ads are limited in spending. Meanwhile, this "reward-punishment mechanism" combines inventory monitoring functions, both improving overall ROI and avoiding stockout risks.

## Ultimate Comparison Between Traditional and Intelligent Methods

Traditional methods are like "manual driving," relying on operators' subjective judgment with slow adjustment and emotional influence. DeepBI is more like "autonomous driving," achieving the following breakthroughs through real-time data feedback and algorithm decision-making:

1. **From passive to proactive**: Traditional operations need to wait for problems before remedying, while DeepBI can predict through analyzing early data trends and intervene in advance.
2. **From local to global**: Manual adjustment often favors one over others, while AI can coordinate all ad groups to maximize overall benefits.
3. **From experience to science**: Human experience has blind spots, while data-driven ensures every bid and budget adjustment has evidence.

We witnessed a seller client with ACOS long hovering above 40% in traditional mode. After switching to DeepBI, the system automatically transferred budgets from inefficient keywords to high-conversion ASIN targeted ads, reducing ACOS to 22% within two weeks while increasing order volume by 35%. This case confirms intelligent operations' core advantage - it's not simply "saving money" but making every budget create greater value.

The essence of high ACOS is structural imbalance between conversion rates and costs. The solution isn't blindly increasing prices but systematically optimizing to improve ad efficiency. DeepBI's value lies in transforming complex advertising operations into precise data calculations, helping sellers escape the quagmire of ineffective competition and achieve sustainable growth in the Amazon ecosystem.
