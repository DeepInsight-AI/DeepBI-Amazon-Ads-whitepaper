# Sales Growing but ACOS Remains High: Solution

Have you also encountered such dilemmas? Ads bring more orders, but month-end accounting reveals profits consumed by advertising costs; manually adjusted hundreds of keyword bids, but ACOS fluctuates like a roller coaster; finally found several high-conversion keywords, but their effectiveness mysteriously declined after a week; envious of conversions from competitor ASINs but don't know how to systematically obtain them; budgets are always insufficient, but unclear which ad groups truly deserve budget increases...

## Deep Thinking Behind Growing Sales but High ACOS

### High Exposure High ACOS Behind is CPC Out of Control

The first common situation is ad exposure and click volume performing well, but cost per click (CPC) remaining high long-term. These ad campaigns appear "healthy" but hide risks. For example, certain keywords are pushed to high bids due to intense competition, bringing massive traffic but conversion rates haven't improved accordingly. More problematic is that manual operations struggle to accurately judge which keywords belong to "high click low conversion" traps - after all, single-day data fluctuations may mask long-term trends, while manually analyzing hundreds of keywords is extremely inefficient.

Traditional optimization methods typically rely on experience-based adjustments: lowering overall bids, pausing poorly performing keywords, or shifting budgets toward historically high-conversion keywords. But this "one-size-fits-all" strategy easily misjudges potential keywords and cannot dynamically respond to market competition changes. We've seen sellers drastically cut budgets to control ACOS, resulting in sales dropping precipitously; also seen cases of blindly pursuing low CPC, causing ad position rankings to plummet and exposure to shrink.

### Natural Contradiction of Low-Price Products Meeting High CPC

The second situation relates to product characteristics. Low-price products have inherently limited profit margins. If CPC exceeds critical values, even with qualified conversion rates, ACOS may still break the break-even line. For example, a $15 product with 30% gross margin means advertising cost per order cannot exceed $4.5. If CPC reaches $1.5, conversion rates need maintaining above 30% to break even - this is extremely high requirements for most categories.

Traditional solutions for such problems test operators' decision-making abilities more: either accept low profits for volume, or abandon ads for organic traffic. But the former is unsustainable, while the latter may miss market share. A more scientific approach is finding the optimal balance point of "CPC-conversion rate" through technical means, which is precisely where AI tools excel.

## How DeepBI Solves These Problems

### Intelligent Filtering of Ineffective Exposure

DeepBI breaks this deadlock through real-time monitoring and dynamic strategies. Its ACOS control strategy is particularly noteworthy: the system automatically identifies keywords with qualified click volume but long-term excessive ACOS, intelligently executing "only reduce, never increase" bid adjustments through algorithm comparison of current bids and actual CPC. The sophistication of this strategy lies in avoiding over-compressing quality keyword exposure while precisely targeting "inefficient spending."

More critically, the system's definition of "long-term poor performance" doesn't simply rely on single-day data but comprehensively considers ACOS trend changes over time, avoiding misjudging keyword value due to short-term fluctuations. For high-ACOS keywords or ASINs, traditional operations may directly disable them, but DeepBI first tries price reduction to observe effects - after all, some keywords are just overpriced rather than completely ineffective.

### More Systematic Optimization

When sales growth and ACOS rise occur simultaneously, it essentially reflects traffic acquisition efficiency issues. Many sellers fall into a cognitive trap: thinking high ACOS means keyword bids are too high, so they mechanically lower bids. This approach often treats symptoms rather than root causes, even causing quality traffic loss. DeepBI establishes complete closed loops from traffic mining to effect amplification through AI-driven dynamic optimization mechanisms. Its core isn't simply reducing ACOS but maximizing value from every advertising budget penny through intelligent identification and resource reallocation.

#### Self-Evolution of Dynamic Traffic Pools

Traditional keyword libraries are static, while DeepBI builds continuously growing living keyword libraries. The system automatically captures two types of golden traffic: buyer search terms with historical orders and healthy ACOS, and high-conversion competitors verified through ASIN targeted ads. This data continuously flows into MANU ad groups, forming positive cycles - good keywords bring conversions, conversions generate new keywords, new keywords create more conversions. During this process, the system intelligently judges which keywords deserve cultivation and which should be eliminated.

#### Tiered Bidding Strategy

DeepBI doesn't treat all keywords "equally." It automatically categorizes keywords into several levels: stable converting keywords, new potential keywords, observation period keywords, and elimination keywords. The DeepBI system will launch "exposure control strategies" for observation period keywords for tentative conservative exploration, not missing any potential explosive order opportunities; adopt gentle price increase strategies for old keywords that continuously bring conversions, ensuring stable output; more aggressively compete for rankings for new keywords that suddenly gained volume recently; simultaneously strictly control exposure opportunities for inefficient keywords. This differentiated management avoids the drawbacks of "one-size-fits-all" bidding.

#### Intelligent Budget Flow

Imagine your advertising budget flowing like water, always finding the most efficient paths. DeepBI monitors input-output ratios of various ad groups in real-time. When an ad campaign continuously produces quality conversions, the system automatically increases its budget ceiling; conversely, gradually contracts resources for long-term poorly performing ad campaigns. This dynamic allocation ensures budgets always flow to places that can create the most value.

#### Precise Strike of ASIN Matrix

Many sellers underestimate the power of competitor ASIN targeting. DeepBI builds ASIN moats through two methods: automatically capturing competitor ASINs that bring conversions, and reverse-finding related ASINs through search terms. These ASINs forming delivery matrices often bring more precise traffic than keywords.

## Summary

It must be admitted that even the most advanced tools cannot resurrect inherently flawed products. If products themselves have quality issues, accumulated negative reviews, or pricing imbalances, ad optimization can only treat symptoms. But for sellers who "could have been profitable but are dragged down by advertising efficiency," intelligent systems' value lies in: liberating operators from repetitive data screening, allowing people to focus on more creative work like product development and user experience.
