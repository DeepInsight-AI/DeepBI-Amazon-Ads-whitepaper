# Solution for New Product High ACOS

## The ACOS Dilemma and Underlying Logic of New Products

Any Amazon seller launching new products faces a common challenge: advertising cost of sales (ACOS) remains stubbornly high. Behind this phenomenon lies Amazon's advertising system logic - newly listed products lack historical sales data, and algorithms cannot accurately identify high-conversion keywords, like shooting arrows blindfolded, with inevitably low initial hit rates. Meanwhile, new products' click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates (CVR) need time to develop, and users need multiple exposures to progress from awareness to trust.

More critically, traditional manual keyword selection often relies on subjective experience or rough competitor analysis, easily falling into two traps: blindly choosing high-traffic broad terms, leading to budget consumption by ineffective clicks; or over-pursuing long-tail keywords, missing core traffic entry points. This dual attack of "empiricism" and "data vacuum" makes new product advertising a bottomless money pit.

## Limitations of Traditional Methods and Breakthrough Paths

Facing this dilemma, traditional operators typically use three approaches: increasing budgets to attack top ad positions, manually screening long-tail keywords, and repeatedly optimizing listing detail pages. While these methods have some effect, they have obvious shortcomings. Budget increases are like "casting a wide net," potentially bringing exposure growth but unable to guarantee traffic precision; manual keyword selection is inefficient and struggles to capture rapidly changing user search trends; listing optimization is fundamental but cannot solve core traffic matching issues through page adjustments alone.

We witnessed an outdoor water bottle new product promoted through traditional methods: the operations team manually adjusted 200+ keywords daily, burning through $5,000 budget in two weeks with ACOS still at 80%. Only after introducing DeepBI's systematic traffic screening mechanism did they discover real high-conversion keywords like "hiking travel water bottle" and "collapsible water bottle" in the third week, with ACOS dropping to 25%. This case reveals the fatal flaw of traditional methods - they rely on post-facto correction rather than prevention, like shooting first then drawing the target, naturally losing cost control.

## DeepBI's Four-Layer Traffic Funnel Revolution

Completely different from traditional "trial and error" methods, DeepBI's AI-driven strategy fundamentally reconstructs new product advertising logic from the ground up. Its core lies in building a four-layer progressive traffic screening mechanism, transforming chaotic initial delivery into a precise data pipeline.

**Exploration Layer Like Casting an Intelligent Fishing Net** In the new product launch stage, the system prioritizes locking competitor detail page ad positions and search results page golden positions for ASIN delivery while using automatic delivery for exploration. ASIN delivery aims to intercept competitor traffic through ASIN ads to obtain converting ASINs while capturing user search intent keywords to obtain converting keywords. For example, a Bluetooth headphone new product initially captured user search terms like "long-lasting Bluetooth headphones" through competitor page bottom ad positions, then fed these behavioral data back to the keyword library. This "war feeding war" model allows cold-start products to quickly accumulate raw data.

Notably, DeepBI's automatic keyword addition strategy excels at this stage. When users place orders through search terms like "men's sweat-resistant sports headphones," the system will record this precise term. In subsequent exploration screening of this term, the strategy will use broad match and phrase match to explore variants like "sweat-resistant Bluetooth headphones" and "fitness-specific headphones," forming keyword expansion links. This order-based keyword expansion is far more aligned with real user needs than manual brainstorming.

**Initial Screening Layer Completes Screening** When the exploration layer accumulates sufficient interaction data, the system will automatically screen two types of golden seeds: ASINs that can bring conversion orders and keyword fragments with potential.

## Precision and Scaling Layers' Dimensional Reduction Strike

Entering the precision layer, algorithms begin showing their ruthless side - only retaining traffic channels that pass stability tests. A kitchen scale product once experienced brutal screening at this stage: of 200 initial keywords, only 18 like "precision baking scale" and "home kitchen 0.1g electronic scale" remained, with others eliminated due to unqualified ACOS values (in fact, the system first reduces prices for average-performing keywords before entering low-price exploration. But if ACOS remains poor under low-price exploration for extended periods, they are finally eliminated). This "wide entry, narrow exit" management ensures every budget penny flows to the most reliable outlets.

When dark horse keywords and ASINs pass all tests, the scaling layer launches turbo mode. The system no longer limits itself to conservative testing but launches saturation attacks on verified quality channels. A pet comb seller witnessed miracles at this stage: the previously accumulated "long-haired cat detangling comb" keyword, after scaling, saw daily orders increase 400% while ACOS dropped 15%. This "spending more to earn more" paradox is precisely the magic of precise traffic screening.

## Ultimate Showdown Between Traditional and Intelligent Methods

Comparing the two models under a microscope, the differences are like horse-drawn carriages versus high-speed rail. Traditional methods rely on manual experience and lagging data with decision cycles lasting days; DeepBI builds real-time feedback loops with data collection to strategy adjustment measured in minutes. More critically, manual operations struggle to handle multi-dimensional variables (like seasonal fluctuations, sudden competitor price drops), while AI systems can simultaneously monitor massive data and comprehensively consider data indicators for automatic error correction.

A double-blind test by a baby products brand was highly convincing: the same baby bib was delivered in two groups, with the traditional team taking three weeks to compress ACOS from 75% to 50%, while the DeepBI group achieved 35% ACOS on day seven with 2.3x higher order volume. This gap isn't luck but systematic traffic screening's dimensional reduction strike on manual experience.

## Summary

For new products struggling in high ACOS quagmire, DeepBI can immediately launch dual-engine strategies: using ASIN ads to attack competitor traffic pools and automatic ads for exploration to quickly establish data baselines; letting AI execute automatic keyword addition to mine "invisible high-conversion keywords" that humans could never think of. Remember, the goal during the new product period isn't immediate profitability but building the most comprehensive "traffic gene library" at minimum cost.

When staring at dismal ad reports late at night, recall this formula: ACOS = advertising spend / sales. Traditional methods only know how to roughly reduce the numerator (budget), while intelligent systems' wisdom lies in simultaneously optimizing the denominator (precise sales). This may be the watershed moment when Amazon advertising transitions from art to science.
