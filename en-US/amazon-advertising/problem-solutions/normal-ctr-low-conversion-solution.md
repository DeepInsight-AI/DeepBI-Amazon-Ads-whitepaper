# Normal CTR but Low Conversion: Deep Solution

## Core Contradiction Behind the Phenomenon

When ad click-through rates remain stable but conversion rates continue to be low, it appears to be a traffic quality and product matching issue, but actually exposes two key flaws in traditional advertising operations: **extensive keyword management** and **passive defensive traffic strategies**.

Taking unreasonable keyword settings as an example, traditional methods rely on manual screening and static keyword libraries, easily falling into two extremes: one is over-pursuing high-traffic broad terms (like "sports shoes"), leading to many irrelevant clicks; the other is sticking to few "safe keywords," missing long-tail precise traffic. More problematic is competitor interception - when users search for target keywords, competitors occupy ad positions through higher bidding or better listings, even using related ads on their detail pages to reverse harvest traffic. A client once had a Bluetooth headphone whose core keyword "wireless earbuds" was monopolized by top brands, with click-through rates as high as 8% but conversion rates below 1%, ultimately discovering 30% of traffic was intercepted by competitor ASIN ads mid-way.

## Traditional Method Optimization Logic and Limitations

Addressing the above issues, traditional operations typically adopt "defense + repair" strategies:

**At the keyword level**, they remove inefficient keywords through search term reports and supplement long-tail keywords. For example, optimizing "sports shoes" to "men's anti-slip running shoes wide toe," matching precise/phrase types. While this method can improve relevance short-term, it has obvious bottlenecks: manual analysis struggles to cover massive data, easily missing hidden high-conversion keywords; long-tail keyword traffic is limited, requiring continuous new keyword mining with extremely high labor costs.

**At competitor defense level**, most sellers choose "price following + listing optimization" dual approach. For example, increasing bids for core keywords while adding comparison charts and videos to product pages, emphasizing differentiated selling points. This method is essentially passive response and relies on experience-based judgment. A client once operated a travel backpack, improving conversion rates from 2% to 4% through keyword and detail page optimization, but competitors immediately adjusted ad position layouts, causing effects to last only two weeks before declining.

The fundamental problem with traditional methods lies in **response lag** and **data fragmentation** - manual optimization cycles are long, while Amazon's traffic competition is dynamic gaming measured in hours.

## DeepBI's Offensive Strategy System

Unlike traditional "defensive" approaches, DeepBI uses AI-driven four-layer traffic mechanisms and proactive interception logic to transform problems into growth opportunities. Its core lies in two disruptive thinking approaches: **using ASIN ads to feed back keywords** and **using competitor traffic pools to cultivate proprietary dark horse keywords**.

### Intelligent Reconstruction of Keyword Optimization

When products suffer low conversion due to poor keyword matching, DeepBI's "exploration-initial screening-precision-scaling" four-layer funnel can quickly locate the root cause. Taking a smart watch as an example, the system first captures real purchase-intent users through ASIN ads on competitor pages (like Brand A's detail page), recording high-relevance keywords in their search paths (like "long-lasting business watch"). These keywords enter the initial screening layer, cross-validating with potential keywords mined by automatic keyword addition strategies (like "titanium band smart watch" discovered by AUTO ads), finally precipitating "dark horse keywords" with low-cost, high-conversion in the precision layer. The entire process requires no manual intervention and can continuously iterate - when dark horse keywords convert again through phrase/broad match, the system automatically includes them in monitoring scope, deriving new keyword libraries.

### Proactive Harvesting of Competitor Traffic

For interception problems, DeepBI takes the opposite approach, converting competitor ASINs into traffic entry points. Its ASIN ad strategy includes dual strike points: directly competing for users below competitor detail pages (especially for products with price/function advantages), and reverse-engineering high-value keywords through competitor-related search terms. For example, a knife brand discovered that manually added competitor ASIN ads brought many "outdoor survival knife" related search terms, which weren't originally captured by keyword tools. More critically, the system dynamically adjusts bids based on real-time data: if a competitor ASIN's conversion cost is lower than keyword ads, it automatically increases its budget ratio, forming a virtuous cycle of "competitor blood transfusion - keyword blood making."

## Effectiveness Comparison Between Old and New Methods

From practical cases, the difference between traditional methods and DeepBI is like the generational gap between "cold weapons and smart missiles." A pet supplies seller once took six months of manual optimization to reduce ACOS from 45% to 28%, while after integrating DeepBI, the system locked onto 12 high-conversion competitors through ASIN ads in two weeks, automatically incubating niche keywords like "cat no-rinse bathing gloves," causing ACOS to drop to 15% with doubled conversion rates.

This advantage stems from three technical pillars:

1. **Data closed loop**: Real-time order data from ASIN ads and search terms directly feedback to keyword libraries, avoiding data silos in traditional methods;
2. **Dynamic offense and defense**: Intelligent strategies not only fully respond to market environment changes and timely adjust strategies but can also proactively attack, intercepting competitor traffic;
3. **Long-tail mining**: AI can intelligently mine keywords that humans struggle to detect, pre-positioning for emerging needs.

## Conclusion

The divergence between click-through and conversion rates essentially reflects the contradiction between "traffic precision" and "competition intensity" in the Amazon ecosystem. Traditional methods attempt to solve multi-dimensional problems with linear thinking, while DeepBI builds dynamic competitive networks through AI - like precise sniper rifles picking off inefficient keywords one by one, and like radar continuously scanning vulnerabilities in competitor defenses. In the current era of soaring traffic costs, this "war feeding war" intelligent strategy is precisely the key for sellers to break through growth bottlenecks.
