# Basic Definitions

- **ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)**: ASIN is a unique identifier assigned by Amazon platform to each listed product, equivalent to the "ID card" of the product in Amazon's system. Each product on Amazon has a unique ASIN used to distinguish it from other products and facilitate product tracking, management, and analysis.

- **Keywords**: Keywords are phrases that customers enter in Amazon's search bar and are also target words set by sellers in ad delivery. Keyword selection directly affects ad display and clicks. Correct selection can improve listing exposure and click-through rates while avoiding ineffective ad spending. Sellers should precisely match based on customer search behavior and intent to improve ad relevance and conversion effects.

- **Impressions**: Impressions refer to the number of times ads are displayed to customers. Each time an ad appears on search results pages or product pages, it generates one impression. Impressions themselves don't directly affect ad sales, but they are the foundation for subsequent conversions. Sellers should increase impressions to attract more potential customers to click ads, thereby driving conversions.

- **Clicks**: Clicks are the number of times customers actually click ads after seeing ads or listings. They reflect ad appeal and ad position effectiveness. Improving clicks usually requires optimizing ad copy, images, and keyword selection elements.

- **CPC (Cost Per Click)**: CPC refers to the fee that merchants need to pay to Amazon platform each time users click on ads placed by merchants in Amazon advertising campaigns. CPC levels directly affect ad delivery costs and effectiveness, usually set through bidding and influenced by market competition and ad quality scores.

- **PPC (Pay-Per-Click)**: PPC is an online advertising pricing model where sellers pay fees for each click by buyer users when placing ads on advertising platforms based on bidding systems and keyword selection. Through PPC ads, sellers can gain exposure on Amazon's search results pages, product detail pages, and other locations, increasing product click-through and conversion rates.

- **Budget Cost**: Budget cost is the total fund ceiling set in ad delivery, including daily budgets and campaign total budgets. Budget cost is used to control overall spending and avoid excessive expenditure. Reasonable budget management ensures ad delivery remains within controllable ranges, avoiding impacts on ad effectiveness due to insufficient budgets or excessive spending.

- **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**: SKU is a unique identifier used by sellers to identify and track each individual product. Each SKU represents a specific product or product variant (such as different colors, sizes, styles, etc.). On Amazon, SKUs are used to identify seller products, helping sellers track inventory, manage orders, and analyze sales data.

- **Listing**: Listing is Amazon's product detail page, including information such as titles, images, bullet points, and descriptions. Listings directly affect product rankings in search engines and customer purchase decisions. Therefore, optimizing listing content can improve the probability of products being found in searches and enhance conversion rates.

- **Competitors**: Competitors are other seller products that sell the same or similar products as you. In advertising, by placing ads on competitor ASINs or targeting competitor keywords, merchants can achieve precise "traffic interception," attracting customers interested in competitors and improving their own product click-through and conversion rates.

- **FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon)**: FBA is a service provided by Amazon that allows sellers to store their products in Amazon's warehouses, with Amazon responsible for product storage, packaging, delivery, and customer service. Sellers using FBA services can enjoy Amazon's delivery network advantages, such as faster delivery speeds, Prime member exclusive delivery, and higher customer trust. FBA usage can improve product visibility and competitiveness, especially in competition with other sellers, providing better market exposure for products.

- **FBM (Fulfillment by Merchant)**: FBM is another fulfillment mode where sellers are responsible for product storage, packaging, delivery, and customer service. In this mode, sellers handle all logistics aspects of orders themselves, including shipping, returns, and customer service. Compared to FBA, FBM requires sellers to manage inventory and logistics themselves, but relatively speaking, costs are lower.
