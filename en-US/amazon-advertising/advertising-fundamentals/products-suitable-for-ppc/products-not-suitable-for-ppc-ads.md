# Products Not Suitable for PPC Ads

For certain products, delivering PPC ads not only cannot bring effective returns but may also lead to ineffective spending. Here are some product types unsuitable for PPC ads.

## 1. Ultra-Low Unit Price Products

Ultra-low unit price products usually refer to products with very low prices and thin profit margins per item. For example, products priced between $1-5. For such products, PPC ads are not economically viable because even if ads bring certain sales, advertising costs may consume almost all profits.

- **Reason**: PPC ad cost per click (CPC) is often related to market competition and keyword popularity. In highly competitive markets, CPC may approach or exceed product unit prices. This means even if ads bring clicks, it's difficult to cover advertising costs, leading to excessive ACOS and ultimately inability to achieve profitability.

## 2. Blood Sea Products

Blood sea products refer to products with very intense market competition where numerous sellers sell similar products. Usually, such products have weak differentiation, many competitors, and severe price competition.

- **Reason**: In blood sea markets, ad delivery effectiveness is usually poor because regardless of ad spending, sellers face intense competition. Even if ads can bring certain traffic, due to lack of product differentiation, conversion rates are usually low. High competition leading to high CPC further increases advertising costs.

## 3. Products with Ultra-Low Conversion Rates

Conversion rate is an important indicator measuring ad effectiveness, and products with low conversion rates usually cannot effectively convert clicks to orders. Low conversion rate products often lack sufficient appeal or have poor product page quality.

- **Reason**: Even if PPC ads can bring massive clicks, if conversion rates are very low, advertising costs cannot bring sufficient returns. Low conversion rates may be due to poor product page optimization, low image quality, uncompetitive pricing, or products not meeting customer needs.

## 4. Products with Few Reviews and Poor Page Optimization

Product review quantity and quality directly affect conversion rates. If products have few reviews and page content and design are not attractive to customers, delivering PPC ads may not bring significant effectiveness.

- **Reason**: On Amazon, customers usually decide whether to purchase based on product reviews and ratings. If products have few reviews or poor reviews, customers may have doubts about the product, causing clicks to fail to convert to orders. At this point, ad effectiveness will be greatly reduced, and advertising costs may far exceed actual revenue.

## 5. Low-Profit Products

Low-profit products refer to products with very small gaps between selling prices and costs, causing sellers to earn low profits from each sale.

- **Reason**: For low-profit products, even if PPC ads bring sales, due to thin profits per product, revenue brought by ads may not cover advertising costs. In such cases, even if order volume increases, sellers may not achieve expected profits.

## 6. Self-Fulfilled Products

Self-fulfilled products refer to products handled and shipped by sellers themselves. Compared to FBA products, self-fulfilled products usually have weaker delivery timeliness and service quality, which may affect customer purchase decisions.

- **Reason**: Amazon customers usually prefer FBA products because FBA provides faster delivery, better customer service, and higher trust. Self-fulfilled products may face delivery delays, return handling issues, etc., thus reducing customer conversion rates.

## 7. Products with Few Search Results or Niche Products

Niche products refer to products with low market demand and few searches. Such products have small exposure on Amazon and often lack traffic support.

- **Reason**: If a product has very few searches, delivering PPC ads cannot bring massive clicks and exposure. This makes it difficult for ad delivery costs to be compensated through sales revenue, leading to ineffective returns on advertising costs.
