# Products Suitable for PPC Ads

Compared to products unsuitable for PPC ads, the following types of products are very suitable for promotion through PPC ads. Understanding these product characteristics helps sellers develop effective advertising strategies.

## 1. High Unit Price Products with Good ACOS

High unit price products usually bring higher single order revenue. These products perform well in PPC ads because even with relatively high CPC, as long as ads bring sufficient sales, sellers can still achieve high profit returns.

- **Suggestion**: For such products, sellers can ensure precise keyword targeting and optimized ad content to ensure ad delivery precisely matches target customers and improves ad effectiveness.

## 2. High-Profit Products

High-profit products refer to products with high selling prices and significant gross profit margins. For such products, PPC ads usually bring good returns because each sale can bring considerable profits.

## 3. Multi-Variant Products

Multi-variant products usually refer to products with multiple colors, sizes, styles, and other variants. These products can attract broader customer groups and have stronger market competitiveness.

Self-developed or micro-innovation products usually have uniqueness and differentiation in the market, can meet specific customer needs, and have high market potential.
