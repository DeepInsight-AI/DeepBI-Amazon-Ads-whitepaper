# What is Ad Display Ranking and Quality Score, and What Are the Influencing Factors?

On Amazon platform, ad display ranking plays a crucial role in ad effectiveness and merchant sales performance. Whether automatic or manual ads, being able to rank at the top of search results not only means more exposure but also higher click-through and conversion rates, thereby driving sales growth. Therefore, understanding and optimizing ad display ranking is one of the keys to Amazon advertising success.

In this article, we will detail why ad display ranking should be valued, the composition of ad quality scores and ad ranking scores, and ad click and charging mechanisms. Through in-depth analysis of these concepts, merchants can better understand the ad delivery process and improve ad delivery return rates by optimizing ad strategies.

## Why Should Ad Display Ranking Be Valued?

Ad display ranking is one of the most important factors in Amazon advertising delivery process. Ad display ranking determines ad display positions in search results pages, and this position directly affects ad exposure, click-through rates, and final conversion rates. Therefore, improving ad display ranking is not only to increase ad visibility but also a key step to improve ad effectiveness and optimize ad investment returns.

- **More exposure and click-through rates**: Ad display ranking directly affects ad exposure and click-through rates. In Amazon search results, ads ranked higher are more likely to be seen and clicked by customers. According to research, ads on the first page of search results usually get more clicks, especially ads ranked higher. Therefore, merchants need to work hard to improve ad display ranking to ensure ads gain sufficient exposure and clicks, thereby improving conversion rates.

- **Ad cost control**: Ad display ranking is also closely related to actual ad spending. In highly competitive markets, merchants must bid high enough to ensure ads rank higher. However, ad display ranking depends not only on bids but also on ad quality. By optimizing ad quality, merchants can not only improve ad display ranking but also achieve good ad effectiveness at lower bids, thereby effectively controlling ad costs and improving investment returns.

Therefore, improving ad display ranking is crucial for improving ad effectiveness and reducing costs. Next, we will detail how to improve ad display ranking by optimizing ad quality scores and ad ranking scores.

## Basic Principles of Ad Display Ranking

### 1. What is Ad Quality Score?

Ad quality score is one of the important indicators Amazon's ad system uses to evaluate ad effectiveness. It not only reflects ad relevance and customer experience but also directly affects ad display ranking and ad costs. Ad quality score is comprehensively evaluated by multiple factors, mainly including:

- **Conversion Rate**: Ad conversion rate reflects the probability of customers purchasing after clicking ads. Higher conversion rates indicate precise target customer groups and ads effectively encouraging customers to complete purchases.

- **Click-Through Rate**: Click-through rate is the frequency of ads being clicked, measured by the ratio of clicks to impressions. High click-through rates indicate ad content can attract customer clicks and strong ad relevance.

- **Ad Historical Performance**: Ad historical performance refers to key indicators like click-through rates and conversion rates during past ad delivery. If ads performed well in the past, the system considers these ads high quality, thus improving ad quality scores.

- **Relevance**: Relevance refers to the matching degree between ads and target customer needs. High-relevance ads can more precisely attract customer clicks and improve ad conversion rates. Amazon evaluates ad relevance based on keywords, ad copy, and target customer search behavior.

- **Category Section**: Category section refers to the matching degree between product categories where ads are placed and selected keywords. High-relevance products and keywords can improve ad quality scores.

Ad quality score levels directly affect ad display opportunities and ad costs. High-quality ads are prioritized by the system, while low-quality ads may be ranked lower, leading to poor ad effectiveness.

### 2. What is Ad Ranking Score?

Ad ranking score is one of the core factors determining ad display ranking. It multiplies ad bids by ad quality scores to get ad ranking scores. The formula is:

$$Ad Ranking Score = Ad Bid Ã— Ad Quality Score$$

Ad ranking score reflects ad competitiveness in Amazon's ad system. Ads with high bids and high quality scores naturally have higher ranking scores, enabling them to gain priority display positions in search results.

- **Ad Bid**: Ad bid is the cost per click set by sellers during ad bidding. Higher bids usually make ad ranking scores higher, thus increasing ad display opportunities. However, relying solely on high bids doesn't necessarily achieve good ad effectiveness; ad quality scores are equally important.

- **Ad Quality Score**: Ad quality score and bids together determine ad ranking scores. Even if sellers increase ad bids, if ad quality scores are low, ad rankings may still be low. Therefore, optimizing ad quality scores and improving bids are equally important.

### 3. Ad Actual Click and Charging Logic

Amazon's ad click and charging mechanism is calculated based on ad ranking scores. The actual click cost calculation formula is:

$$Actual Click Cost = \frac{Next Ad Ranking Score}{Ad Quality Score} + 0.01$$

Through the above formula, sellers can see how actual costs per click are calculated based on ad ranking scores. If sellers' ads rank higher, their click costs are lower, while lower-ranked ads need to pay higher click costs.

- **Next Ad Ranking Score**: Cost per click is determined by lower-ranked ads' scores. Specifically, fees sellers pay for each click are calculated based on ranking scores of ads with lower scores than their ads. Therefore, maintaining high ad quality scores can effectively reduce click costs.

- **Ad Quality Score**: Higher ad quality scores mean sellers pay lower click costs compared to other competing ads. This is because Amazon encourages high-quality ads to improve customer experience.

## Factors Affecting Ad Ranking

In previous sections, we detailed Amazon ad display ranking basic principles and clarified how ad rankings are determined through interaction between ad quality scores and ad bids. However, ad display ranking doesn't rely solely on these two factors. In fact, many complex factors affect ad display ranking, and these factors intertwine to jointly determine ad display positions in Amazon search results. Therefore, sellers must understand these factors and improve ad display ranking through optimization strategies.

This section focuses on specific factors affecting Amazon ad display ranking, including bids, keyword competition levels, click-through rates, conversion rates, relevance, user satisfaction, and SKU inventory status. Through in-depth analysis of these factors, sellers can adjust ad strategies based on actual situations and optimize ad effectiveness.

### 1. Impact of Bids

Bids are one of the most direct factors determining ad rankings. In Amazon's ad system, sellers set bids for each ad delivery, i.e., cost per click. Higher ad bids give greater advantages in ad bidding, thus having higher chances of achieving better ad rankings. However, although higher bids can improve ad display ranking, bids aren't the only determining factor. Amazon's ad system considers not only bids but also comprehensively evaluates ad quality scores. Therefore, sellers cannot rely solely on bids to improve ad rankings but must optimize ad quality scores to ensure higher rankings within reasonable budgets.

**Optimization Strategy**: Reasonably set bidding prices to ensure optimal display positions within budget ranges. Timely adjust bids, especially for high-competition keyword ads, avoiding excessive bidding causing ad budget waste.

### 2. Keyword Competition Level

Keyword competition level is another key factor determining whether ads can successfully display. In Amazon advertising, keywords are the foundation of ad display, and keyword popularity and competition levels directly affect ad exposure frequency. High-competition keywords usually bring more traffic but also accompany higher CPC and lower conversion rates. In such cases, ad display positions are often contested by other sellers, leading to lower ad rankings. While less competitive keywords have less traffic, they usually provide more cost-effective display opportunities.

**Optimization Strategy**: Based on ad delivery effectiveness, analyze keyword competition situations, appropriately select high-conversion, low-competition long-tail keywords, or balance delivery with popular keywords and some long-tail keywords with market potential. Through this strategy, sellers can improve ad exposure at lower costs.

### 3. Click-Through Rate

Click-through rate refers to the frequency of ads being clicked, reflecting ads' ability to attract customers. Higher ad click-through rates mean better matching between ad content, display positions, and customer needs. Amazon's ad system evaluates ad relevance based on click-through rates, so click-through rates directly affect ad display ranking. Ad click-through rates are usually related to ad creative and content quality. If ad titles, images, copy, and keywords precisely match customer needs, click-through rates can be improved. Higher click-through rates not only help ads improve exposure but also improve ad quality scores, thus indirectly improving ad rankings.

**Optimization Strategy**: Continuously optimize ad creative content, including titles, images, descriptions, etc., to improve ad appeal and click-through rates. Regularly analyze ad data, optimize poorly performing ad materials, ensuring ads can precisely target potential customers.

### 4. Conversion Rate

Conversion rate refers to the proportion of customers who actually purchase after clicking ads. Higher conversion rates indicate better ad effectiveness and ads effectively encouraging customers to complete purchases. Conversion rates directly affect ad cost-effectiveness because higher conversion rates mean each ad click brings higher sales revenue, and relative ad costs can get higher returns. Conversion rates are related to multiple factors, mainly including product page quality, pricing, customer reviews, shipping methods, etc. Amazon evaluates ad quality based on conversion rates, thus affecting ad display ranking.

**Optimization Strategy**: Optimize product pages, ensuring product descriptions, images, pricing, and customer reviews can attract customers to purchase. Improving conversion rates not only helps reduce ACOS but also improves overall ad effectiveness. Through data analysis, identify ads with low conversion rates and adjust ad strategies to ensure ads achieve optimal conversion effectiveness.

### 5. Relevance

Ad relevance refers to the matching degree between ads and customer searches. High-relevance ads can better meet customer needs and attract clicks. Amazon's ad system evaluates ad quality based on relevance, thus affecting ad display ranking. Relevance is mainly determined by keyword selection, ad copy design, and product page optimization. Higher keyword relevance usually leads to higher ad click-through and conversion rates, thus improving ad rankings.

**Optimization Strategy**: Select keywords highly relevant to products and ensure ad copy highly matches customer search intent. Continuously optimize keyword selection and ad content relevance to improve ad effectiveness and rankings.

### 6. User Satisfaction

User satisfaction is another important factor evaluating ad effectiveness. Amazon platform highly values customer shopping experience, so user satisfaction directly affects ad rankings. High-satisfaction ads usually gain more exposure and higher click-through rates, while low-satisfaction ads may face ranking decline and increased ad costs. User satisfaction is related to multiple factors, including product quality, logistics service, customer service, etc. Higher customer satisfaction usually means lower return rates and higher repurchase rates, thus improving ad long-term effectiveness.

**Optimization Strategy**: Sellers should focus on improving overall customer shopping experience, enhancing user satisfaction in all aspects from product quality and packaging to after-sales service. Good customer reviews not only help improve ad conversion rates but also improve ad quality scores, thereby improving ad rankings.

### 7. SKU Inventory Status

SKU inventory status is also an important factor affecting ad display ranking. Products with insufficient inventory or out of stock cannot only fail to sell effectively through ads but may also cause ad ranking decline. When advertised products are out of stock, ad display frequency decreases and may even stop displaying. Amazon platform tends to display products with sufficient inventory and timely shipping. Ads for products with insufficient inventory or out of stock will reduce ad relevance and quality scores, thus affecting ad display ranking.

**Optimization Strategy**: Ensure advertised products have sufficient inventory, avoiding affecting ad delivery effectiveness due to stockouts. Sellers can use inventory warning systems to plan restocking in advance, ensuring products are always available for sale during ad delivery periods.
