# Evaluation Metrics

- **ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales)**: ACOS measures the percentage of advertising expenses invested in Amazon advertising relative to the sales revenue generated. ACOS is one of the core indicators for evaluating ad effectiveness and advertising return on investment. Its basic calculation formula is as follows:

$$ACOS = \frac{Advertising Spend}{Ad Sales Revenue} \times 100\%$$

This indicator directly reflects ad delivery efficiency and is a key basis for judging whether ads are profitable. Ordinary sellers set target ACOS between 20-40%, and only ACOS below the profit margin "break-even ACOS" is considered profitable.

- **CVR (Conversion Rate)**: Refers to the proportion of actual purchases completed through ad clicks relative to total clicks. Conversion rates can effectively measure product page quality and ad effectiveness. Its basic calculation formula is as follows:

$$CVR = \frac{Number of Orders}{Number of Clicks} \times 100\%$$

High conversion rates indicate strong ad and product page appeal, effectively encouraging customers to complete purchases from clicks. If CTR is high but CVR is low, it usually indicates that ad content attracts customer clicks, but page experience is insufficient, causing customers to not complete purchases.

- **ROI (Return on Investment)**: A key indicator measuring advertising input-output ratio, representing the proportion of revenue brought by ads relative to advertising costs, i.e., the quotient of advertising net revenue and costs. Its basic calculation formula is as follows:

$$ROI = \frac{Revenue - Cost}{Cost} \times 100\%$$

In advertising operations, ROI is used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of advertising campaigns and can determine whether ads effectively bring positive returns through this indicator. If ROI is high, it indicates that ad delivery is profitable, otherwise ad strategies need optimization.

- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**: ROAS is a key indicator measuring ad delivery effectiveness, reflecting the sales return brought by each unit of advertising expenditure. Simply put, it's the proportional relationship between advertising costs and sales revenue generated through ads. Through this indicator, advertisers can evaluate whether ad delivery effectively brings profits. Its basic calculation formula is as follows:

$$ROAS = \frac{Ad Sales Revenue}{Advertising Spend} \times 100\%$$

ROAS is an important tool for evaluating ad effectiveness, helping advertisers determine whether to adjust ad budgets, optimize ad materials, or choose different ad target audiences. By improving ROAS, advertisers can maximize ad benefits and ensure ad delivery brings sustainable profit growth.

- **TACOS (Total Advertising Cost of Sales)**: A comprehensive evaluation indicator used to measure the ratio of total advertising expenditure to total sales revenue brought by ads + organic conversions. Its basic calculation formula is as follows:

$$TACOS = \frac{Advertising Spend}{Ad Sales Revenue + Organic Sales Revenue} \times 100\%$$

TACOS can reflect the impact of ads on overall business, helping sellers judge whether ads are in a healthy development mode. By tracking TACOS, sellers can understand the synergistic effects of ads and organic traffic and adjust ad delivery strategies to ensure advertising expenditure can promote overall business growth.

- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: As the name suggests, it measures the frequency of ads being clicked after exposure. Its basic calculation formula is as follows:

$$CTR = \frac{Number of Clicks}{Number of Impressions} \times 100\%$$

This indicator reflects whether ad titles, images, and products precisely hit user needs, i.e., the appeal of ads to users.
