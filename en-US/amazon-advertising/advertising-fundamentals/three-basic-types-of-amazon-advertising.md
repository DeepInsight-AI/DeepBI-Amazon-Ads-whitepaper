# Three Basic Types of Amazon Advertising

Amazon's advertising system mainly includes the following advertising formats:

- **Sponsored Products (SP Ads)**: This is Amazon's most basic and common advertising format, allowing sellers to recommend their products to potential customers in search results. SP ads' core is triggering ads through keywords or automatic matching, with ads displayed on search results pages or product detail pages.

- **Sponsored Brands (SB Ads)**: SB ads allow sellers to display multiple brand products in the same ad position, usually appearing at the top or bottom of search results pages. They not only improve brand exposure but also help sellers promote multiple products and attract more customers.

- **Sponsored Display (SD Ads)**: This advertising format displays on other websites and applications outside the Amazon platform, helping sellers attract potential customers who have previously browsed their products, enhancing remarketing effectiveness.

## Ad Delivery Mode Overview

In Amazon's advertising ecosystem, SP ads are undoubtedly the most commonly used and influential advertising format. They are not only the most basic and widespread advertising delivery format on Amazon platform but also one of the advertising strategies merchants often rely on. According to the latest industry data, SP ads consistently dominate Amazon advertising sales, contributing approximately 70% to 80% of advertising sales revenue. For merchants, SP ads are also the most convenient and user-friendly. Products delivered through Amazon SP ads will be distributed across search results pages and product detail pages, making them more likely to be clicked and purchased by Amazon platform users.

In Amazon's advertising ecosystem, in addition to SP ads which most buyers consider as the first choice and most influential, SB ads and SD ads are also very important advertising formats, each with their unique roles and advantages. To help readers comprehensively understand Amazon advertising diversity, this book will focus on explaining Sponsored Products (SP) operation methods and provide brief introductions to Sponsored Brands (SB) and Sponsored Display (SD) advertising types. This section aims to help seller readers better understand these three advertising formats and develop reasonable and efficient strategies in advertising operation practice by focusing on their basic delivery methods and characteristics.

## Sponsored Products (SP)

SP ad delivery formats mainly include **Automatic Ads (AUTO)**, **Manual Ads (MANU)**, and **ASIN Ad Delivery** three methods. Each method has its unique characteristics, advantages, and applicable scenarios, and sellers can choose different ad modes for delivery based on actual needs.

### AUTO Ad Delivery Method

Automatic ads (AUTO) are an ad delivery method where Amazon's system automatically matches keywords and ad display positions. Sellers only need to provide product information, and the system will choose appropriate keywords and display ads based on product characteristics, market demand, and customer behavior data. AUTO ads' advantage lies in their high automation level, requiring minimal manual setup and adjustment from sellers, suitable for initial delivery and data collection.

**AUTO Ad Keyword Expansion Methods**: AUTO ad keyword expansion is mainly completed through Amazon's automatic matching algorithms. The system will automatically select keywords and display ads based on product characteristics and customer search relevance. Specific expansion methods include:

- **Close Match**: In this mode, the system selects keywords most relevant to products for matching. For example, if a seller sells "Bluetooth headphones," the system might select "wireless headphones" or "Bluetooth headphones" as close match keywords. Close match keywords usually highly align with product functions and characteristics, thus bringing higher click-through and conversion rates.

- **Loose Match**: In this mode, the system selects keywords with lower relevance to products but still related to customer interests. For example, the system might select keywords not completely related to "Bluetooth headphones," such as "speakers" or "headphones," with broader matching ranges but potentially lower conversion rates.

- **Substitutes**: In this mode, ads will be displayed to customers searching for products with similar functions to sellers' products. For example, if customers search for "Bluetooth headphones," the system might display ads for other brands or styles of headphones to achieve substitute product matching.

- **Complements**: In this mode, ads are displayed to customers searching for products complementary to sellers' products. For example, when customers purchase "Bluetooth headphones," the system might push related Bluetooth accessories or headphone cases.

### MANU Ad Delivery Method

Manual ads (MANU) require sellers to manually select keywords and deliver ads. Compared to AUTO ads, MANU ads allow sellers to have more precise control over ad delivery, suitable for sellers with higher ad delivery requirements. Sellers can choose precise keywords and control ad budgets, bids, etc., to ensure more targeted ad delivery.

**MANU Ad Keyword Matching Methods**: MANU ad keyword matching has three methods: Exact Match, Phrase Match, and Broad Match. Each matching method has different characteristics, and sellers can choose the most suitable method based on target audiences and ad effectiveness.

- **Exact Match**: Exact match is the strictest matching method, where ads only display when customer search terms exactly match sellers' selected keywords (in English, only allowing simple variants like singular/plural and -ing forms). For example, if a seller selects "Bluetooth headphones" as an exact match keyword, ads will only display when customers search "Bluetooth headphones." Exact match brings more precise traffic with higher conversion rates, but display opportunities (exposure) are relatively fewer.

- **Phrase Match**: Phrase match allows customer searches containing selected keyword phrases (order should also remain consistent). For example, if a seller selects "Bluetooth headphones" as a phrase match keyword, ads will also display when customers search "wireless Bluetooth headphones" or "portable Bluetooth headphones." Phrase match has broader traffic range than exact match but still ensures ad relevance to customer searches.

- **Broad Match**: Broad match is the most lenient matching method, where ads display for all search terms related to selected keywords. For example, selecting "Bluetooth headphones" as a broad match keyword, ads might display when buyer users search related terms like "headphones," "wireless speakers," or "headphone Bluetooth." Broad match's advantage lies in wide traffic coverage, but conversion rates are relatively lower.

### ASIN Ad Delivery Method

ASIN ad delivery is a unique mode in Amazon advertising, mainly selecting to deliver product ads from two positions:

- **Ad positions below competitor detail pages**: The logic of this ad position is that when users browse competitor products, Amazon will recommend ads related to the product (competitor) at the bottom of the page, providing excellent opportunities for precise traffic interception. If the advertised product is superior to competitors in comprehensive aspects, it can achieve traffic interception from competitors.

- **Ad positions on keyword search results pages**: Ad positions displayed after users actively search.

**ASIN Ad Targeting Methods**: ASIN ad delivery is usually suitable for situations where sellers hope to compete with specific products. ASIN ad targeting mainly has two methods: precise targeting and expanded targeting.

- **Exact Targeting**: Precise targeting means ads will only be delivered to product detail pages or search pages highly related to specific ASINs. For example, sellers can select a competitor's ASIN as a precise target to display ads to customers browsing that product. Precise targeting's advantage lies in very precise ad delivery, able to lock onto competitor customer groups.

- **Broad Targeting**: Broad targeting allows ads to display on product detail pages or search pages similar or related to selected ASINs. For example, sellers can select iPhone 15's ASIN and deliver ads to Huawei phone detail pages or search pages. Broad targeting's advantage lies in expanding ad display range, thus gaining more exposure.

## Sponsored Brands (SB)

SB ads mainly improve brand exposure, help merchants increase brand awareness, and ultimately drive sales growth. Compared to SP ads, SB ads have a significant difference: they can display multiple products, not just single items. Therefore, SB ads can not only increase single product exposure but also leave brand impressions in customers' minds, further improving brand influence. SB ads mainly have three common display formats: Product Collection, Store Spotlight, and Video Ads. Through these three ad formats, SB ads can help sellers improve brand exposure and product awareness, especially suitable for merchants focusing on brand building. Whether through displaying multiple related products or carefully designed brand stories, SB ads can help sellers attract potential customers at different levels.

- **Product Collection Ads**: Product collection ads allow sellers to display multiple related products in one ad instead of single products. This ad format is very suitable for sellers with multiple categories or wanting to promote multiple products. Through this ad, sellers can display their brand products to potential customers at once, thus improving overall brand exposure.

- **Store Spotlight Ads**: Store spotlight ads can guide customers to visit sellers' brand store pages. This ad can centrally display brand core products, brand stories, and other related marketing content, aiming to improve brand authority and appeal. Through store spotlight ads, customers can understand brands' complete product lines and have more brand interactions.

- **Video Ads**: Video ads use vivid dynamic images and sound to show customers product characteristics and brand concepts. This ad format is particularly suitable for enhancing customer interest in products and helping brands convey more emotion and stories. Video ads can provide higher engagement, helping brands leave deep impressions on customers.

## Sponsored Display (SD)

SD ads, as another advertising format provided by Amazon for sellers, aim to improve product exposure through ad display, especially using remarketing strategies to push ads to potential customers after they browse related products. SD ads are not limited to search results pages but display in various positions outside Amazon platform through display ads, including product detail pages, shopping cart pages, etc. Compared to SP and SB ads' passive delivery (only displaying to customers when they search), SD ads are proactive display ads that can actively display to customers inside and outside Amazon by analyzing user behavior. SD ads mainly have two delivery types: Audience Targeting and Product Targeting.

- **Audience Targeting**: Audience targeting allows sellers to target ad delivery through customer behavior data. Through this method, sellers can display ads to customers who have previously browsed related products or have potential purchase intent. Audience targeting can improve ad relevance through precise customer data, thus increasing conversion rates. Audience targeting's working mechanism is based on Amazon's massive user data system, with ads intelligently pushed based on customer browsing history, purchase preferences, and other information. Sellers can use this data to optimize ad display, improve ad precision, and reduce ineffective traffic waste.

- **Product Targeting**: Product targeting is another main SD ad delivery method, where sellers can choose specific products for targeted ad display. Through this method, sellers can display their ads on related product pages, directly attracting potential customers' attention. Product targeting is not only suitable for competitive environments but also helps sellers gain more exposure opportunities in specific product categories. For example, if a competitor's product is very popular, sellers can use product targeting to display ads on that product's page, thus attracting potential customers' attention and increasing their own click-through and conversion rates.
