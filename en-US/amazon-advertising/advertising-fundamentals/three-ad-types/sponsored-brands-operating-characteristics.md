# Sponsored Brands (SB) Operating Characteristics and Techniques

SB ads are a form of Amazon advertising aimed at helping sellers improve brand awareness and promote potential customer contact with brands. Unlike other advertising formats, SB ads don't just promote single products but focus on brands, displaying multiple products or store links. This advertising format can help sellers increase brand exposure, attract user attention, and promote sales. For merchants, understanding SB ad advantages, characteristics, and delivery techniques is an important step in improving ad effectiveness and optimizing brand image. This section will detail SB ad advantages, characteristics, and how to maximize SB ad effectiveness through reasonable delivery strategies.

## SB Ad Advantages and Functions

### 1. Brand Exposure and User Memory Enhancement

A significant characteristic of SB ads is their ability to display brands to potential customers, not just single products. This characteristic makes SB ads a powerful tool for improving brand exposure and promoting brand recognition. By displaying ads with brand logos on Amazon's search results pages, SB ads can effectively attract user attention. Especially in intense market competition, brand exposure and memory become particularly important.

In daily life, many consumers don't completely remember specific product names or brands when purchasing, but they may remember a brand's appearance or other details. SB ads not only attract customer attention by displaying brand logos and multiple products but also help them recall the brand when they have potential needs, thereby facilitating purchases. For example, on Amazon's search results pages, SB ads can directly guide customers to brand store pages. This approach helps customers learn more about the brand, further improving customer brand recognition and enhancing brand memory. Whether in off-seasons or peak seasons, continuous brand ad delivery ensures users prioritize your brand when making purchase decisions.

### 2. Guide Traffic to Store

Another core advantage of SB ads is their ability to guide customers to sellers' store pages. By setting ad targets as brand stores or multiple products, sellers can display ads to customers searching for related products and guide them to their brand stores. This strategy not only increases product exposure opportunities but also gives customers more understanding of the brand. After guiding customers to store pages, merchants have opportunities to display more product information, brand stories, and other related content on a more centralized platform, thereby strengthening connections between brands and customers. Through this method, SB ads not only improve single product sales but also promote long-term brand development from a global perspective.

### 3. Enhance Brand Loyalty

Through multiple exposures and interactions, brands can gradually build customer trust and loyalty. SB ad display formats usually include brand logos, selected products, and targeted promotional information. Through frequent contact and recognition of brands, customers are more likely to trust the brand and make purchase decisions. As brand awareness continues to improve, customer repurchase rates may also increase accordingly, ultimately driving long-term brand growth.

### 4. Attract Different Types of Customers

SB ads not only attract customers with direct needs but also attract potential customer groups by improving overall brand exposure. On Amazon platform, customer purchase paths are diverse. Some customers may not immediately show interest in a specific product, but after seeing related brand ads, they become interested in the brand and further browse more related products. Through SB ad display, merchants can expand ad coverage and reach more potential customers.

### 5. Increase Brand Ad Competitiveness in Search Results

When merchants display their brands and products through SB ads, ad position priority is often higher. This means when customers search for certain specific products, SB ads can appear at the top of search results pages, even above product ads, thereby increasing brand exposure opportunities. Especially in highly competitive categories, SB ads can help brands stand out and attract more clicks and attention.

## SB Ad Delivery Techniques

Although SB ads have strong brand effects, reasonable delivery strategies are crucial to achieve expected ad effectiveness. Here are some techniques and methods for optimizing SB ad delivery effectiveness. Sellers can flexibly adjust strategies based on different ad goals.

### 1. Choose Correct Ad Targets

When creating SB ads, merchants can choose different ad targets. For example, ads can be targeted as "promoting brand products" or "improving brand store exposure." Choosing correct ad targets is crucial for ad effectiveness. Here are several common SB ad targets:

- **Promote Brand Store**: If the goal is to increase brand store visits and improve brand exposure, merchants can choose to target ads to brand stores. This method can effectively attract customers interested in the brand and guide them to browse other products in the store.

- **Promote Multiple Related Products**: If sellers hope to improve exposure for multiple products, SB ads can display multiple products and guide customers to these products' detail pages. This method is very suitable for sellers with diverse product lines, allowing customers to more comprehensively understand the brand and its products.

### 2. Set Reasonable Budgets and Bids

Similar to other ad modes, SB ad budget and bidding strategies directly affect ad effectiveness. Setting appropriate budgets ensures ads can fully gain exposure and avoid missing potential traffic due to insufficient budgets. Bidding settings are one of the important factors affecting ad display frequency and position.

Sellers can adjust budgets based on ad performance, especially in early ad launch stages. Merchants need to continuously adjust ad delivery budgets and bids based on data analysis. Appropriately increasing bids can increase ad display frequency in search results, especially in highly competitive categories, where increasing bids helps gain better ad positions.

### 3. Optimize Ad Creative and Copy

SB ad creative and copy design also directly affect ad effectiveness. Creative visual presentation and copy writing should capture customer attention, highlight brand unique selling points, and clearly communicate product core advantages. Ad copy should be concise and clear, highlight brand value, and call for customer clicks. An attractive title and visually impactful image are keys to improving click-through rates.

Additionally, merchants can regularly test different ad creatives and copy, conduct A/B testing, and find combinations that most appeal to target customers.

### 4. Continuously Monitor Ad Performance and Optimize

Like other ad modes, SB ads also need continuous optimization and adjustment. Sellers should regularly monitor ad performance data, including click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates (CVR), ACOS (advertising cost of sales), and other indicators. This data can help merchants judge ad effectiveness and make timely adjustments.

- **Pause Poor-Performing Ads**: If certain ads perform poorly, merchants can pause these ads to avoid wasting ad budgets.

- **Increase Budget and Bids**: For well-performing ads, merchants can increase budgets and bids, expand ad coverage, and further improve brand exposure.

- **Adjust Keywords and Negative Keywords**: Merchants should regularly analyze search term reports, understand which keywords perform well, and optimize keywords based on actual performance, add or delete negative keywords to avoid ads wasting ineffective traffic.

### 5. Leverage Seasonal and Holiday Promotions

Seasonal changes and holiday promotions are important opportunities for brands to improve exposure and sales. By leveraging these opportunities, merchants can design more targeted SB ad campaigns. For example, during holiday shopping seasons, merchants can increase brand ad delivery to ensure brands can stand out in intense market competition.
