# Sponsored Display (SD) Operating Characteristics and Techniques

Sponsored Display (SD) ads are another advertising format provided by Amazon for sellers, aimed at improving product exposure through ad display, especially using remarketing strategies to push ads to potential customers after they browse related products. SD ads are not limited to search results pages but display in various positions outside Amazon platform through display ads, including product detail pages, shopping cart pages, etc. Compared to SP and SB ads' passive delivery (only displaying to customers when they search), SD ads are proactive display ads that can actively display to customers inside and outside Amazon by analyzing user behavior. SD ads mainly have two delivery types: Audience Targeting and Product Targeting.

## Audience Targeting

Audience targeting allows sellers to target ad delivery through customer behavior data. Through this method, sellers can display ads to customers who have previously browsed related products or have potential purchase intent. Audience targeting can improve ad relevance through precise customer data, thus increasing conversion rates. Audience targeting's working mechanism is based on Amazon's massive user data system, with ads intelligently pushed based on customer browsing history, purchase preferences, and other information. Sellers can use this data to optimize ad display, improve ad precision, and reduce ineffective traffic waste.

## Product Targeting

Product targeting is another main SD ad delivery method, where sellers can choose specific products for targeted ad display. Through this method, sellers can display their ads on related product pages, directly attracting potential customers' attention. Product targeting is not only suitable for competitive environments but also helps sellers gain more exposure opportunities in specific product categories. For example, if a competitor's product is very popular, sellers can use product targeting to display ads on that product's page, thus attracting potential customers' attention and increasing their own click-through and conversion rates.

## Key Advantages of SD Ads

### 1. Proactive Display Strategy

Unlike search-based ads that only appear when customers actively search, SD ads can proactively reach customers based on their browsing behavior and interests. This allows sellers to capture potential customers who may not be actively searching but have shown interest in related products.

### 2. Remarketing Capabilities

SD ads excel at remarketing by targeting customers who have previously viewed or interacted with similar products. This increases the likelihood of conversion by reaching customers who have already shown purchase intent.

### 3. Cross-Platform Reach

SD ads can display on various platforms outside Amazon, expanding the reach beyond the Amazon ecosystem and potentially capturing customers who don't frequently use Amazon for product discovery.

## Optimization Strategies for SD Ads

### 1. Audience Segmentation

- **Interest-Based Targeting**: Target customers based on their browsing and purchase history
- **Behavioral Targeting**: Focus on customers who have shown specific behaviors (viewing, adding to cart, etc.)
- **Demographic Targeting**: Use available demographic data to refine audience selection

### 2. Product Selection for Targeting

- **Competitor Analysis**: Identify high-performing competitor products for targeting
- **Complementary Products**: Target products that complement your offerings
- **Category Expansion**: Target broader product categories within your niche

### 3. Creative Optimization

- **Visual Appeal**: Use high-quality images that stand out in display environments
- **Clear Value Proposition**: Highlight unique selling points and benefits
- **Call-to-Action**: Include compelling CTAs that encourage clicks

### 4. Performance Monitoring

- **Conversion Tracking**: Monitor conversion rates from different audience segments
- **Cost Analysis**: Track cost per acquisition (CPA) and return on ad spend (ROAS)
- **A/B Testing**: Test different creative variations and targeting strategies

## Best Practices for SD Ads

1. **Start with Broad Targeting**: Begin with broader audience targeting and refine based on performance data
2. **Monitor Frequency**: Avoid over-exposing the same audience to prevent ad fatigue
3. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Adjust targeting and creative based on seasonal trends and shopping patterns
4. **Cross-Reference with Search Data**: Use search term data from other ad types to inform SD targeting
5. **Budget Allocation**: Allocate appropriate budgets based on audience size and competition levels

By following these strategies and continuously optimizing based on performance data, sellers can effectively leverage SD ads to reach new customers and improve overall advertising ROI.
