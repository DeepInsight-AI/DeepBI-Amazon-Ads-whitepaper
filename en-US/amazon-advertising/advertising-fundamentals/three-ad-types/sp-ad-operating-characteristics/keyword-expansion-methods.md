# Keyword Expansion Methods

In Amazon advertising, keyword selection and expansion are crucial for advertising effectiveness. Keyword expansion helps sellers cover a broader range of potential customers by expanding target keywords while ensuring advertising precision to improve conversion rates and reduce advertising costs. Based on different advertising modes, Amazon provides different keyword matching methods and expansion strategies to help sellers achieve more efficient advertising delivery.

This section will detail keyword expansion methods in Amazon advertising, covering different matching methods in AUTO advertising mode, MANU advertising mode, and ASIN advertising mode. Each advertising mode's keyword expansion method has its unique role in practice. Through reasonable selection and application, advertising optimization and maximum delivery effectiveness can be achieved.

## I. Keyword Expansion Methods for AUTO Advertising Mode

AUTO advertising mode (automatic advertising mode) is an automated delivery method for Amazon advertising. Sellers don't need to manually select keywords; the system automatically generates and selects relevant keywords for ad display based on product titles, descriptions, backend search terms, and other information. Although AUTO advertising mode greatly simplifies operational processes, sellers can still improve advertising effectiveness by analyzing advertising data and optimizing keyword expansion strategies.

In AUTO advertising mode, keyword expansion mainly includes the following matching methods:

### 1. Close Match

Close match is the most common keyword matching method in AUTO advertising, meaning ads will be displayed to those searching for terms highly related to product characteristics and descriptions. For example, if a product's title and description contain "black women's handbag," close match ads will be displayed to customers searching for "black handbag" or "women's handbag."

- **Function**: Close match ensures ads are displayed to customers highly related to the product, improving advertising precision. Usually, this matching method can bring higher click-through rates and conversion rates because it meets customer search needs.

### 2. Loose Match

Loose match allows ads to be displayed to broader search terms and related keywords. Compared to close match, this matching method covers a wider range of keywords. For example, for the product "black women's handbag," loose match ads might be displayed to customers searching for "women's bags" or "black bags."

- **Function**: Loose match is suitable for situations wanting to expand ad exposure, helping ads cover more potential customer groups. Although conversion rates might be lower, loose match can bring more traffic to ads by increasing exposure.

### 3. Substitutes Match

Substitutes match allows ads to be displayed to customers searching for other products similar to the seller's product. For example, if a seller runs ads for "black women's handbag," the system will automatically display ads to customers searching for black women's handbags from other brands.

- **Function**: Substitutes match helps sellers capture traffic from competing products, increasing ad exposure. Especially in highly competitive markets, this matching method helps sellers attract potential customers and improve ad conversion rates.

### 4. Complements Match

Complements match enables ads to be displayed to customers searching for products complementary to the seller's product. For example, customers searching for "black women's handbag" might also be interested in "women's scarves" or "women's wallets," and the system will display ads to these potential customers.

- **Function**: Complements match can expand product exposure through cross-category advertising, increasing additional sales opportunities. For products that can be used together, complements match helps sellers improve average order value and sales.

## II. Keyword Expansion Methods for MANU Advertising Mode

MANU advertising mode (manual advertising mode) requires sellers to manually select keywords and set bidding prices for each keyword. Unlike AUTO advertising, MANU advertising mode allows sellers more control, enabling them to choose precise keywords and adjust based on advertising effectiveness.

In MANU advertising mode, keyword expansion methods usually include exact match, phrase match, and broad match. Each matching method helps precisely control ad display targets and improve advertising effectiveness.

### 1. Exact Match

Exact match means ads are only displayed to customers searching for terms exactly matching the selected keywords. For example, if a seller chooses "black women's handbag" as a keyword, only customers searching for "black women's handbag" will see the ad.

- **Function**: Exact match provides the highest relevance for ad display because ads are only shown to customers searching for terms exactly matching the keywords. This usually brings higher click-through rates and conversion rates, suitable for customers with clear purchase intentions.

### 2. Phrase Match

Phrase match means ads are displayed to customers searching for terms containing the keyword phrase. For example, if a seller chooses "black women's handbag" as a phrase match keyword, ads will be displayed to customers searching for "black women's handbag leather" or "women's black handbag."

- **Function**: Phrase match provides certain flexibility, expanding keyword coverage. While improving exposure, it maintains relatively high relevance. Phrase match is suitable for sellers wanting to expand ad scope while not wanting to cover completely irrelevant search terms.

### 3. Broad Match

Broad match means ads are displayed to customers searching for any terms related to the keywords. For example, if a seller chooses "black women's handbag" as a broad match keyword, ads might be displayed to customers searching for "women's bags" or "black bags."

- **Function**: Broad match provides the widest coverage, helping sellers attract a broader range of potential customers. Although conversion rates might be lower, broad match keywords help increase ad exposure, especially suitable for sellers wanting to expand market share.

## III. Keyword Expansion Methods for ASIN Advertising Mode

ASIN advertising mode (product targeting advertising) is an advertising delivery method based on specific products (ASIN), where ads are displayed to customers searching for related ASIN products. Unlike AUTO and MANU advertising, ASIN advertising mainly achieves ad display through product-to-product relationships, so keyword expansion methods are relatively simpler.

Keyword expansion methods in ASIN advertising mode mainly involve precise targeting and expansion targeting:

### 1. Precise Targeting

Precise targeting refers to advertising delivery by selecting ASINs highly related to the seller's product. Ads are only displayed to customers searching for these specific ASINs, ensuring ads can precisely reach customers interested in similar products.

- **Function**: Precise targeting helps sellers quickly gain exposure in low-competition environments, reducing ineffective clicks and waste. It's usually suitable for products with clear positioning and defined target customer groups.

### 2. Expansion Targeting

Expansion targeting expands ad audience by selecting other ASINs related to the seller's product for advertising delivery. Unlike precise targeting, expansion targeting allows ads to be displayed to customers searching for related or similar products.

- **Function**: Expansion targeting helps sellers target customers interested in similar or complementary products, improving ad exposure and conversion rates. For sellers with multiple related products, expansion targeting is an effective advertising strategy.

## IV. Summary of Keyword Expansion Methods

Keyword expansion methods are the core of optimizing Amazon advertising effectiveness. AUTO advertising mode automatically matches relevant keywords through automatic matching, suitable for sellers to quickly start advertising and increase exposure; MANU advertising mode provides higher control, allowing sellers to precisely deliver ads through exact match, phrase match, and broad match, optimizing conversion rates; ASIN advertising mode focuses on helping sellers precisely capture competitor traffic through product-to-product relationships, improving advertising effectiveness.

Through reasonable application of keyword expansion methods under different advertising modes, sellers can better control advertising budgets, improve advertising precision, and ultimately achieve higher conversion rates and return on investment.
