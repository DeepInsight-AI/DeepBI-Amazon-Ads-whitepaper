#### II. Characteristics and Advantages of MANU Ads

##### 1. **Definition of MANU Ads**

**MANU Ads** (Manual Ads) are another advertising method provided by Amazon, where sellers need to select keywords themselves and set bid prices for each keyword. Manual ads allow sellers to have better control over keyword selection and advertising strategies, thereby improving the precision and effectiveness of ads.

##### 2. **Advantages of MANU Ads**

-   **Precise Control**: Unlike AUTO ads, MANU ads allow sellers to have complete control over the keywords being targeted and set different bid prices for different keywords. Sellers can choose broad keywords, exact keywords, or long-tail keywords based on market demand and advertising goals.
-   **Improved Conversion Rate**: Since MANU ads involve manual keyword selection, sellers can ensure that ads are shown to the most relevant customers. Through keyword optimization, sellers can improve click-through rates and conversion rates while reducing ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales).
-   **Large Optimization Space**: Manual ads provide sellers with more optimization opportunities. During the advertising process, sellers can adjust keywords, modify bids, add negative keywords, etc., based on data analysis to improve ad performance and reduce costs.

##### 3. **Limitations of MANU Ads**

The disadvantage of MANU ads lies in the significant time and effort required for optimization and management. Sellers must conduct keyword research, select appropriate keywords, and set reasonable bid prices for them. Additionally, since keyword selection and bidding strategies require high attention from sellers, when ad performance is not ideal, sellers need to make detailed adjustments based on data, which can be challenging for sellers without sufficient advertising experience.

##### 4. **Keyword Types and Traffic Distribution**

In MANU ads, keyword selection and types are key factors determining ad effectiveness. Keywords can be roughly divided into three categories: Broad Keywords, Exact Keywords, and Long-tail Keywords.

-   **Broad Keywords**: Broad keywords typically refer to general search terms related to products, with high search volume and significant traffic. These keywords have wide coverage and can bring substantial exposure, but with lower conversion rates, as they may be shown to less precise customers. Broad keywords are suitable for increasing exposure and expanding market share, but require reasonable bidding and optimization strategies.
-   **Exact Keywords**: Exact keywords are specific keywords highly relevant to products, capable of precisely reaching target customers. Although exact keywords have lower search volume, their conversion rates are typically higher, as they can better match customer search intent. Exact keywords are suitable for improving ad conversion rates, but attention should be paid to bid control to avoid excessive bidding leading to high ACOS.
-   **Long-tail Keywords**: Long-tail keywords are specific search terms composed of multiple words, with relatively low search volume but high conversion rates. Long-tail keywords typically bring high-quality traffic and have less competition, resulting in lower CPC. Long-tail keywords are suitable for precisely targeting niche markets and usually help sellers reduce advertising costs while improving advertising ROI.
