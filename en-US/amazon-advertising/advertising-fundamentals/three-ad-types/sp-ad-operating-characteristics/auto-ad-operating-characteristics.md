#### I. Characteristics and Advantages of AUTO Ads

##### 1. **Definition of AUTO Ads**

**AUTO Ads** (Automatic Ads) are an advertising method provided by Amazon, where the Amazon system automatically selects relevant search terms and products for ad display based on product information and keyword matching rules. In this approach, sellers do not need to manually select keywords; the system automatically analyzes sellers' products and market demand through algorithms, recommends suitable keywords, and places ads on relevant search results pages.

##### 2. **Advantages of AUTO Ads**

-   **Convenience**: AUTO ads do not require sellers to manually select keywords, making them very suitable for sellers without extensive advertising optimization experience. The system automatically generates keywords and conducts ad placement, greatly simplifying the ad management process.
-   **Efficient Traffic Capture**: AUTO ads, through Amazon's automatic matching algorithm, can capture more potential customers and keywords, making it less likely to miss any relevant traffic opportunities. Especially when sellers don't have time or resources for keyword research, AUTO ads can quickly obtain substantial exposure through their powerful automation mechanisms.
-   **Low-barrier Entry Method**: For new sellers or new products, AUTO ads are an ideal entry method. They allow sellers to quickly launch ad campaigns and obtain initial traffic without extensive preliminary optimization.

##### 3. **Limitations of AUTO Ads**

Although AUTO ads are very convenient, they also have their limitations. First, since the system automatically selects keywords, sellers cannot have complete control over ad display. Second, the click-through rate and conversion rate of AUTO ads may not be as high as MANU ads, as they may be shown to some less relevant customers. Therefore, while AUTO ads are suitable for the launch phase, to improve ad effectiveness, sellers still need to optimize and adjust based on ad data.
